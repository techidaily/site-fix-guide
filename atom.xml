This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a <strong>touchscreen problem</strong> on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg"                      alt="android restart method"                ></p><p>To restart your Android, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the <strong>Power</strong> button as well as the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button at the same time.</p><h3 id="Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android"></a>Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android</h3><p>Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Backup and Reset.</strong> Next, tap on <strong>Factory data reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete all</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg"                      alt="android factory data reset"                ></p><p>Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode"></a>Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode</h3><p>If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Placing your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Xiaomi 13T.</p><p><strong>Step 1A</strong>: Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button and <strong>Volume Down</strong> buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1B</strong>: If your Xiaomi 13T still has a <strong>Home</strong> button, press and hold the <strong>Home</strong> button and the <strong>Power</strong> button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1C</strong>: If step 1A did not put your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the <strong>Volume</strong> buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset, and confirm your choice with the <strong>Power</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 02"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for the process to complete and for your Xiaomi 13T to restart automatically.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen"><a href="#Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen"></a>Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen</h3><p>If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the <strong>touchscreen problem,</strong> it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Xiaomi 13T checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg"                      alt="图像"                >“</p><h3 id="Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center"><a href="#Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center" class="headerlink" title="Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center"></a>Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center</h3><p>Your <strong>phone touch problem</strong> might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Fix-Android-Touch-Problem-With-an-Alternative"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Fix-Android-Touch-Problem-With-an-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Fix Android Touch Problem With an Alternative"></a>Part 3: How To Fix Android Touch Problem With an Alternative</h2><p>If all the general <strong>phone touch problems</strong> on your Xiaomi 13T persist, you should strongly consider <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-repair/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> to do the job.

Install the software to your Mac or Windows computer by following the onscreen instructions.</p><p>Once completed, open the software, so you’re on the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="snapchat crashing -  fix with a tool"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: From the main menu, click the System Repair option, followed by the <strong>Android</strong> option. Of course, if you have an iOS device you want to repair in the future, the option is there if you want it. Also, connect your Xiaomi 13T to your computer using the USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-1.png"                      alt="snapchat crashing - select option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Confirm details.</p><p>On the next screen, use the drop-down menus to confirm the model, brand, operating system, and carrier of your device. Click Next to confirm the details are correct.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="snapchat crashing - select details"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You’ll now need to put your phone into Download Mode, sometimes referred to as Recovery Mode. For this, you can follow the onscreen instructions. Make sure your device stays connected to your computer throughout this process.</p><p>The method will slightly differ depending on whether your device has a home button, so make sure you follow the right instructions for your individual device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-3.png"                      alt="snapchat crashing - recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once in Download Mode, the software will now download and install a fresh version of your Xiaomi 13T’s operating system. This can take some time, so make sure your device stays connected, and your computer stays on and doesn’t shut down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-5.png"                      alt="snapchat crashing - download firmware"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> That’s it! Once you see the screen saying your device has been repaired, you’ll be able to close the Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android) software, disconnect your phone, and can start using Snapchat as normal without the Snapchat not responding error coming up!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-9.png"                      alt="snapchat crashing - fixed issue"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-5-Check-for-the-Android-update"><a href="#Part-5-Check-for-the-Android-update" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s how, which will help to sort out your Snapchat keeps crashing Android problems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Settings menu on your Xiaomi 13T and select the About Phone option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the ‘Check for Updates’ option. If an update is available, you’ll then have the option to Install Now or Install Overnight. If no update is available, you’ll see a notification stating your device is up to date and no action is needed.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Connect-to-another-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Part-6-Connect-to-another-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi"></a>Part 6. Connect to another Wi-Fi</h2><p>In some cases, you may be trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network that’s not very stable. This may keep cutting the connection to your device, which in turn is causing Snapchat to crash on Android.</p><p>To resolve this, you can simply try connecting to another Wi-Fi network or a data plan to see whether this is the problem. If so, changing network and then using the Snapchat app should stop any error messages from occurring.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Settings menu on your Xiaomi 13T, followed by the Wi-Fi option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-change1.png"                      alt="snapchat stopping - connect to wifi"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the new Wi-Fi network you’re currently connected to, and then tap the ‘Forget’ option, to stop your phone connecting to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-change2.png"                      alt="snapchat stopping - forget wifi"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the new Wi-Fi network you want to connect to. Insert the Wi-Fi security code and connect. Now try reopening and using the Snapchat to see if you can use it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-change3.png"                      alt="snapchat stopping - reconnect wifi"                ></p><h2 id="Part-7-Stop-using-the-custom-ROM"><a href="#Part-7-Stop-using-the-custom-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 7.

Here’s how to factory reset your device.</p><p>Make sure you back up your personal files from your device first like your photos and music files because factory resetting your device will clear your device’s memory.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Tap the Settings menu on your device and click the Backup and Reset option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Reset Phone option. That’s it! The phone will take several minutes to complete the process, after which your phone will be reset to its original state.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/solved-warning-camera-failed-on-vivo-x100-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Solved Warning Camera Failed on Vivo X100 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-motorola-moto-g13-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Revive Your Bricked Motorola Moto G13 in Minutes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/quick-fixes-for-why-is-my-infinix-smart-8-hd-black-and-white-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Quick Fixes for Why Is My Infinix Smart 8 HD Black and White | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-xiaomi-redmi-a2-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Xiaomi Redmi A2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reasons-for-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-of-oppo-a1x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Phone Touchscreen Of Oppo A1x 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-infinix-smart-7-hd-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Revive Your Bricked Infinix Smart 7 HD in Minutes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-oneplus-ace-2-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked OnePlus Ace 2 Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-of-oneplus-nord-n30-se-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Phone Touchscreen Of OnePlus Nord N30 SE | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unfortunately-contacts-has-stopped-error-on-honor-x50-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Unfortunately, Contacts Has Stopped Error on Honor X50 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reasons-for-vivo-s18-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Vivo S18 Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/proven-ways-to-fix-there-was-a-problem-parsing-the-package-on-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Proven Ways to Fix There Was A Problem Parsing the Package on Samsung Galaxy A15 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/huawei-nova-y91-stuck-on-screen-finding-solutions-for-stuck-on-boot-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Huawei Nova Y91 Stuck on Screen – Finding Solutions For Stuck on Boot | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-vivo-t2-pro-5g-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Vivo T2 Pro 5G Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reasons-for-motorola-edge-40-pro-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Motorola Edge 40 Pro Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-htc-u23-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked HTC U23 Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/my-videos-arent-playing-on-meizu-21-pro-what-can-i-do-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>My Videos Arent Playing on Meizu 21 Pro – What Can I Do?

It is indeed a streak of copies of the desired app storing information and incurring additional space on the storage. This might be the reason why the contact app crashes rapidly on your Vivo V30. Hence, it can prove to be a good remedy for this problem. Just follow down the steps mentioned below-</p><ol><li>First of all, go to “Settings” application from the app drawer or from the notification panel.</li><li>Now, surf and select for “Applications” or “Apps &amp; notifications”.</li><li>Here, you need to browse for “Contacts” app and open it.</li><li>On “Contacts” app, just tap on “CLEAR CACHE” and “CLEAR DATA” button.

These are of little importance as they are bound to become a bit more corrupted in nature. And sometimes, may indirectly become a hurdle for the working of contacts app. It is good if the Vivo V30 device is cleared off from the caches. Instead of manually wiping down the cache memory, we will understand how to clear off the cache partition in the following steps.</p><ol><li>From device, just power off your device. Then, press the “Volume Down + Power” button with “Home” combinations together.</li><li>In a moment’s time, lose fingers from the “Power” button but do not release fingers from “Volume Down” and “Home” buttons.</li><li>Once you view the “Android System Recovery” screen, just lose the “Volume Down” and “Home” buttons.</li><li>Over the options available, just opt for “wipe cache partition” by tapping the “Volume down” button until the desired option is highlighted.</li><li>Finally, push the “Power” key to give consent to the selection.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/wipe-cache-partion.jpg"                      alt="contacts app stopping - wipe cache partition"                ></p><ol start="7"><li>After, the process is through there will be an option for “Reboot System Now”.

Here is the quick reference for disabling Google+ application.</p><ol><li>First of all, visit “Settings” from your Vivo V30.</li><li>In “Settings”, visit the “Application Manager” or “Applications” menu and browse for “Google +” app.</li><li>From the application main page, you can choose to do either of the methods:</li></ol><ul><li>Either, completely disable the application to work by pressing on “Force stop” or “Disable” feature.</li><li>Or, brush away the unnecessary cache piled up on your storage by using “Clear Cache” functionality.</li></ul><p>There will be a prompt stating that the application may misbehave. However, you must disable the feature and check whether it worked out for you or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-google-plus-cache-data.jpg"                      alt="contacts app crashing - clear google+ cache"                ></p><h3 id="2-5-Update-your-device-software"><a href="#2-5-Update-your-device-software" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Update your device software"></a>2.5 Update your device software</h3><p>Many a times, we skip updating our device software thinking it is of less importance.

Updating your Vivo V30’s software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.</p><p>To update the software on your Vivo V30, follow these steps:</p><p>Go to “Settings” on your Vivo V30 and navigate to the “System” or “Software Update” section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to “Check for updates” to see if any new software updates are available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off.jpg"                      alt="update software"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off"><a href="#Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off"></a>Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off</h2><p>When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Vivo V30 device’s internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone’s internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.</p><p>To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off-1.jpg"                      alt="cool down the phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode"></a>Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode</h2><p>Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function.

You should see “Safe Mode” displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.</li><li>Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Vivo V27 Pro device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode.

It’s no surprise that smartphone touchscreens are one of the most common components to fail, given their delicate glass construction. However, a <strong><strong>part of the touch screen not working</strong></strong> on your Itel P40 does not necessarily mean it is a hardware issue. There could be other reasons why your Android’s touch screen stopped responding.</p><p>If your phone’s touchscreen frequently fails to respond, there are several things you can try before calling a professional. This article will reveal those proven fixes you can easily perform independently.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Part-of-My-Screen-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Part-of-My-Screen-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working"></a>Part 1. Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working</h2><p>There are two possible causes as to why your phone’s touch screen is not working. One is the touch screen may have been damaged, and the other is the Itel P40 device may be experiencing technical difficulties.</p><p>If you drop your phone and it becomes stuck against something, the touch screen’s connectivity may fail. Only a part of the touch screen may sometimes become damaged and unresponsive. That may also occur when there is a technical failure, such as the phone hanging. A <strong><strong>part of the touch screen not working</strong></strong> can occur when malware is downloaded or when phone settings are changed.</p><p>Now, the problem can affect any Android phone, and users may encounter the following error messages on their respective phone models:</p><ul><li>Itel P40 P40 lite <strong><strong>half touch screen not working</strong></strong></li><li>Nexus touch screen not working</li><li>LG screen is unresponsive to touch</li><li>Itel P40 <strong><strong>left side of the screen is not working</strong></strong></li><li>Redmi’s whole screen is unresponsive to touch</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Types-of-Touch-Screen-Issues-and-What-You-Should-Check-Before-Fixing"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Types-of-Touch-Screen-Issues-and-What-You-Should-Check-Before-Fixing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Different Types of Touch Screen Issues and What You Should Check Before Fixing"></a>Part 2. Different Types of Touch Screen Issues and What You Should Check Before Fixing</h2><p>You may experience a variety of touch screens not working on Android issues:</p><ul><li>A certain <strong><strong>part of the touch screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li><li>Your touches do not register on the touch screen.</li><li>The touch screen incorrectly responds to your touch.</li><li><strong><strong>Half touch screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li><li>The touch screen becomes frozen or hangs.</li><li>The screen flashes, flickers, or remains blank.</li><li>The<strong><strong>left side of the phone screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p>Before proceeding to how to fix an unresponsive touch screen on an Android device, you should complete the following steps:</p><ul><li>Examine the screen of your device. Check to see if it is cracked or chipped.</li><li>If the screen is damaged, it must be replaced.</li><li>Remove the Itel P40 device cover and screen protector if they are not damaged.</li><li>If there is a sticker on the Itel P40 device screen, you must remove it.</li><li>Before continuing, make sure your screen is spotless.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Fix-Part-of-the-Touch-Screen-Not-Working-No-Physical-Damage"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Fix-Part-of-the-Touch-Screen-Not-Working-No-Physical-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)"></a>Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)</h2><p>If you have already tried running the Itel P40 device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Itel P40’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.</p><h3 id="Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Restart Your Device"></a>Restart Your Device</h3><p>When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Hold the “Power” button until the Itel P40 device turns off.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG"                      alt="restart android with power button"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> When the Itel P40 device turns off, wait a few seconds.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Itel P40 device.</p><p>Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.</p><h3 id="Turn-On-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Turn-On-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Turn On Safe Mode"></a>Turn On Safe Mode</h3><p>You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.</p><p>If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> To force a restart, press and hold the Itel P40 device’s “Power” button for an extended period.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> When you let go of the “Power” button, press and hold the “Volume Down” button. After that, a “Safe Mode” label will appear in your screen’s lower-left corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-2.JPG"                      alt="turn-on-safe-mode-android"                ></p><h3 id="Turn-Off-Developer-Options"><a href="#Turn-Off-Developer-Options" class="headerlink" title="Turn Off Developer Options"></a>Turn Off Developer Options</h3><p>Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.</p><p>If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Launch the <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select the <strong><strong>System</strong></strong> menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Advanced options menu, then select Developer Options.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> You will then find the switch to turn it on or off. Disable itby toggling the button off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-3.PNG"                      alt="turn off developer options in android"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 5:</strong></strong> Restart your device to check if the part of the touch screen not working issue has been resolved.</p><h3 id="Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings"><a href="#Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Device to Factory Settings"></a>Reset Device to Factory Settings</h3><p>Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Go to <strong>Find My Device</strong> from any d<strong><strong>evice</strong></strong> and sign in to the Google account associated with the damaged screen device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> After successfully logging in, you will see your device’s name. Select the <strong><strong>Erase Device</strong></strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-4.JPG"                      alt="google find my device feature"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Confirm by pressing the <strong><strong>Erase Device</strong></strong> button.</p><p><strong><strong>Tip:</strong></strong> Since all your data will be removed, it’s recommended to <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/"><u>back up your data</u></a> first before resetting your device to factory settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-5.JPG"                      alt="erase device to factory reset android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Fix-Using-a-Third-Party-App-–-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Fix-Using-a-Third-Party-App-–-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Even minor connectivity issues can cause these problems, leaving you wondering what’s wrong with your device or displaying the “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working.” error message.</p><p>Software errors are another set of problems that can also cause this issue. Namely, an average phone user has at least 40 installed apps, and sometimes these apps don’t play well together. They generate problems or steal resources from each other, such as RAM, causing crashes and errors.</p><p>There’s also the issue of wrong app versions.

Before you reset your phone to factory settings, ensure you’ve backed up all your essential apps and files. When you’re ready, you can do a factory reset by following these steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>and search for “<em>reset</em>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose <strong>Factory reset</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap the <strong>Erase all data</strong>or <strong>Reset device</strong> at the bottom, whichever button is there.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-2.jpeg"                      alt="android factory reset"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Input your password and confirm the action.</p></li></ul><p>Your phone will now restart and start the reset process. Once the factory reset completes, your phone will look brand new, and you’ll need to install all your apps again. Moreover, your Google Play Services app will likely get fixed by this, too.</p><h3 id="2-Update-Your-System"><a href="#2-Update-Your-System" class="headerlink" title="2. Update Your System"></a>2. Update Your System</h3><p>As keeping your phone’s system and apps updated to the latest possible version is essential and recommended for the best performance and highest efficiency, you can try updating it to see whether it fixes your Google Play Services error. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong></li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Head into <strong>System</strong>&gt; <strong>System update</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: If there’s an update available, click it and go through the process of updating your phone’s system.</li></ul><p>Restarting your phone after an update, even if it doesn’t restart itself, is highly advisable, ensuring that the new updates apply without issues.</p><h3 id="3-Revert-to-the-Previous-Version"><a href="#3-Revert-to-the-Previous-Version" class="headerlink" title="3. Revert to the Previous Version"></a>3. Revert to the Previous Version</h3><p>As we’ve discussed the wrong Play Services versions above, it’s worth noting that sometimes even the developers can make mistakes and roll out the wrong version for your phone. So, if you notice that the phone is getting the error after you’ve updated Google Services or the Play Store, you can quickly revert to the previous version, and here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Google Play Services.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Press the <strong>Disable</strong>button at the bottom of the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Restart the phone, repeat the process by clicking <strong>Enable</strong>this time, and restart the phone again.</li></ul><p>As these are system apps, you can’t remove them from the phone, and disabling them will only remove the updates, leaving you with a base version that came with your phone out of the box.</p><h3 id="4-Uninstall-the-App’s-Updates-and-Reinstall"><a href="#4-Uninstall-the-App’s-Updates-and-Reinstall" class="headerlink" title="4. Uninstall the App’s Updates and Reinstall"></a>4. Uninstall the App’s Updates and Reinstall</h3><p>Like reverting to the previous version, you can also try reinstalling updates to fix the Google Play Services has stopped working error. The process is similar to the one above, but we’ve still included the steps. Here’s how you can do that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find <strong>Google Play Services</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap it and press <strong>Uninstall Updates</strong>at the bottom.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-3.jpeg"                      alt="uninstall google play services updates"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Exit the <strong>Settings</strong>app and restart the phone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Open the <strong>Play Store</strong>app and head into the app’s settings by clicking your profile icon. Then scroll to the bottom, and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Find and tap the <strong>Play Store version</strong>to update your <strong>Google Play Services</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>As you’re already there, you might as well update all other apps after you tap <strong>Manage apps &amp; device</strong>. That will ensure that older and not-up-to-date apps aren’t causing the issue.</p><h3 id="5-Check-Storage"><a href="#5-Check-Storage" class="headerlink" title="5. Check Storage"></a>5. Check Storage</h3><p>Believe it or not, one of the leading causes of the Google Play Services issue is a phone overfilled with apps. Namely, if you have insufficient storage, the Google Play Store app will likely crash and display errors such as “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working.”</p><p>Head into your phone’s Settings and select Storage to see how your phone’s doing storage-wise. Deleting a few apps you don’t use and transferring your photo and video library to a PC is highly advisable if your phone’s storage space lacks gigabytes.</p><h3 id="6-Do-a-System-Repair"><a href="#6-Do-a-System-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Do a System Repair"></a>6. Do a System Repair</h3><p>Although the other solutions here are general fixes that might help, a system repair might take a bit longer but will undoubtedly fix your issue. You can use the Wondershare Dr.Fone app to repair the system and eliminate the annoying “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working” error.</p><p>Moreover, Dr. Fone works on Android and iOS devices and can fix various phone issues, including boot loops, a white screen of death, a stuck phone, etc. That’s why we’ve included a guide on using it for an Android phone issue.

Give the software a few minutes to complete, during which your phone might restart a few times. Once it’s done, your Google Play Services app will undoubtedly work.</p><h3 id="7-Clear-Cache"><a href="#7-Clear-Cache" class="headerlink" title="7. Clear Cache"></a>7. Clear Cache</h3><p>The easiest and the most obvious fix for many Android apps is clearing the app’s cache. Here’s how you can do that for Google Play Services and Google Play Store:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find the <strong>Google Play Store</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap <strong>Storage</strong>and hit the <strong>Clear cache</strong></p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-10.jpg"                      alt="clear app cache"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Repeat the process for the <strong>Google Play Services</strong></p></li></ul><p>If this doesn’t work, move on to another possible fix.</p><h3 id="8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings"><a href="#8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings" class="headerlink" title="8. Check Date and Time Settings"></a>8. Check Date and Time Settings</h3><p>Oddly enough, the Google Play Services app is prone to failure because of an incorrectly set time or date. That’s because Google’s servers constantly check these settings before issuing updates to the Itel P40 devices, so you’ll need to ensure they’re correct beforehand. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Ensure that both “**<em>Use network–provided time</em><strong>” and “</strong><em>Use network-provided time zone</em>**” are toggled on.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-11.jpg"                      alt="check date and time settings"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If this doesn’t work, you can try repeating the process and manually setting the time and the time zone.</p></li></ul><p>Once you check or change these settings, try using the Google Play Store app and check whether the issue is fixed. Restarting the phone after changing the settings is also highly advisable.</p><h3 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection"></a>9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection</h3><p>Another regularly overlooked troublemaker is a poor internet connection. That’s because most apps nowadays are meant to work in online mode only, and losing connection or using a bad one interferes with the app’s functionality.</p><p>To test the internet connection on your Itel P40, you should open a browser and head to a random internet page to see if it’s opening and whether there are any delays. If it’s working fine, your internet connection isn’t the problem.</p><h3 id="10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions"><a href="#10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions"></a>10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions</h3><p>Although permissions rarely change, they can cause issues if you change them accidentally. These settings can be found in the same place where you would uninstall updates or clear the app’s cache, so you can use some of the steps mentioned above to check them.</p><p>Once inside Permission Settings, check whether the Google Play Services and Play Store apps have sufficient permission to do their jobs and whether any required permissions were recently removed. If so, grant these two apps their permissions back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>4,953,228</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although it’s an incredibly frustrating error, the “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped” message is more annoying than serious. We’ve explained why it happens, but we’ve also given you a list of solutions to fix it.</p><p>Our list includes various fixes, from simple ones, like deleting the app’s cache and ensuring your network works fine, to more serious ones, like doing a factory reset. Alternatively, you can do a system repair with the help of Wondershare Dr.Fone, which will certainly fix the problem, but it might be a bit more complicated than cache deletion.</p><h2 id="Solved-Warning-Camera-Failed-on-Itel-P40"><a href="#Solved-Warning-Camera-Failed-on-Itel-P40" class="headerlink" title="[Solved] Warning: Camera Failed on Itel P40"></a>[Solved] Warning: Camera Failed on Itel P40</h2><p>In this article, you will learn why camera fails on Itel P40 devices, how to make camera work again, as well as a system repair tool to fix this issue in few clicks.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png"                                     ></a></p><p>Itel P40 devices are one of the best Android devices available in the market and their users are always satisfied with their features.

And to do this, all you need is to go to the “Settings” in your device and tap on “About Phone”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will see a “Software Info” option. Tap on it and scroll to the build number. Tap on it 7 times and you will see the developer options getting enabled on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As we are using Android, you need to head to the Google Play Store and look for the app on it. Now, install and then open it to proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> While the app is launched, tap on the “ENABLE” option located at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/enable-mock-location.jpg"                      alt="enable mock location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you will be directed to the Developer options page.

If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.</p><p>However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.</p><p><strong>Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Tinder in your Honor X9a as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/tinder+.jpg"                      alt="tinder plus"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Send-and-Fake-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-Of-your-Honor-X9a"><a href="#How-to-Send-and-Fake-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-Of-your-Honor-X9a" class="headerlink" title="How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Honor X9a"></a>How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Honor X9a</h2><p>Do you want to learn how to fake a live location on Messenger?

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your OnePlus Nord 3 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your OnePlus Nord 3 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully.

To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable&#x2F;USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My OnePlus Nord 3 5G won’t charge the issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985010302112.jpg"                      alt="check charging adapter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Try-another-power-source"><a href="#4-Try-another-power-source" class="headerlink" title="4.

They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5s.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device. So if your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device’s animation type and speed on your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is running slow and freezing, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues"></a>Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues</h3><p>Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is running slow and freezing.</p><h3 id="Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable"><a href="#Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable" class="headerlink" title="Your Internet Connection is Unstable"></a>Your Internet Connection is Unstable</h3><p>Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-My-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-Lags"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-My-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-Lags" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When My Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Lags?"></a>What to Do When My Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Lags?</h2><p>It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow.

This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.</p><p>With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.</p><p>To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/simple-solutions-to-fix-android-systemui-has-stopped-error-for-nokia-c32-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Simple Solutions to Fix Android SystemUI Has Stopped Error For Nokia C32 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-flash-dead-huawei-nova-y91-safely-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Flash Dead Huawei Nova Y91 Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-poco-f5-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Poco F5 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-not-working-on-honor-x50-gt-8-solutions-inside-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Not Working On Honor X50 GT? 8 Solutions Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/proven-ways-to-fix-there-was-a-problem-parsing-the-package-on-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Proven Ways to Fix There Was A Problem Parsing the Package on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-not-working-on-samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-8-solutions-inside-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Not Working On Samsung Galaxy A54 5G? 8 Solutions Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-itel-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Itel A05s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-realme-12plus-5g-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked Realme 12+ 5G Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/solved-warning-camera-failed-on-tecno-spark-10-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Solved Warning Camera Failed on Tecno Spark 10 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/change-location-on-yik-yak-for-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-to-enjoy-more-fun-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Change Location on Yik Yak For your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to Enjoy More Fun | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-infinix-hot-40i-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked Infinix Hot 40i Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-honor-x7b-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked Honor X7b Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-unbrick-a-dead-nubia-z50-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Unbrick a Dead Nubia Z50 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-sony-xperia-5-v-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Sony Xperia 5 V Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-google-pixel-8-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Google Pixel 8? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-zte-nubia-flip-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked ZTE Nubia Flip 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/stuck-at-android-system-recovery-of-huawei-nova-y91-fix-it-easily-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Stuck at Android System Recovery Of Huawei Nova Y91 ?

There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Xiaomi 13T Pro device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Xiaomi 13T Pro, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both.

Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM.

Similarly, a user does feel some unexpected turns of events resulting in <strong><em>Play Store to stick at downloading</em></strong>. If one happens to see that the progress bar has suddenly frozen to a certain scope and taking ages to march any further, it is treated as the first signs for Play store not working properly. Another, such scenario is where your apps are not able to download easily. Rather, the Play store reflects a message downloads are yet in the pending queue. If one happens to witness such problems, these can be in fact be giving you the warning signal of the Play store problem</p><h2 id="Part-2-Causes-of-why-“Play-Store-Stuck-on-Downloading”"><a href="#Part-2-Causes-of-why-“Play-Store-Stuck-on-Downloading”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Causes of why “Play Store Stuck on Downloading”"></a>Part 2: Causes of why “Play Store Stuck on Downloading”</h2><p>With technology, uncertainties are bound to happen. It becomes quite tricky to analyze the real problem and craft a solution. As, there can be several causes that might be disturbing the smooth functionality of Play store. Here are some collated issues that we’ve gathered that are indicative of the cause.</p><ol><li><strong>The time is not rightly setup:</strong> Sometimes, the unexpected root cause of play store failing to work is due to the date and time not set up rightly.

Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably.

Now from the list of options before you, select “Backup and reset” and move ahead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14997069833129.jpg"                      alt="backup and reset" title="backup and reset"                ></p><p>3. Now you must first select “Factory data reset” and then tap on “Reset Device” as shown in the screenshot below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14997070083006.jpg"                      alt="factory data reset" title="factory data reset"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14997070259341.jpg"                      alt="reset device" title="reset device"                ></p><p>4. Finally, you have to click on “Erase Everything” and wait for the Poco X5 Pro device to reboot itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14997070554687.jpg"                      alt="erase everything" title="erase everything"                ></p><p>Note: You will have to set up your Poco X5 Pro device from scratch once it is reset, however, that is a small price to pay to fix your Camera App.</p><p>Warning: Camera Failed error is not a rare phenomenon and many users experience it on daily basis.

The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.</p><p>As of now, you cannot run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> as it is only available for Android and iOS. <em>Why?</em> Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the <strong><em>Life360 app for Windows</em></strong>. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the <strong><em>Life360 app on Windows</em></strong>.</p><p>So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?"></a>Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?</h2><p>First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get <strong><em>Life360 for PC</em></strong>. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.</p><p>In this situation, you can simply run the <strong><em>Life360 app on PC</em></strong>. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.</p><p>Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?"></a>Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?</h2><p>Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.</p><p>The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.</p><p>However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and <strong><em>run the app on a Windows PC</em></strong>. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.</p><p>These methods include:</p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator"></a>Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator</h2><p>The first and the most convenient way to run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.</p><p>While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.</p><p>Here’s how you can run <strong><em>Life360 on a computer</em></strong> using Bluestacks Android emulator.&#x2F;</p><p>Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.</p><p>Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-1.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-2.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: In the home screen, tap the “Google Play Store” icon. You’ll be asked to sign-in with your Google account. Enter the right credentials and log-in to the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-3.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 13"                ></p><p>Step 5: In the top search bar, type-in Life360 and tap the “install” button to download the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-4.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 5"                ></p><p>Step 6: Life360 is now installed on your computer. Open the app and enter your login details. You’ll now be able to run Life360 on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-5.jpg"                      alt="bluestacks 5"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Use-Life360-by-mirroring-Android-to-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-4-Use-Life360-by-mirroring-Android-to-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC"></a>Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC</h2><p>While running an emulator is a great way to get <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em>,</strong> it has its own set of challenges. For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.</p><p>In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.</p><p>Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.</p><p>Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 3"                ></p><p>Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 4"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer. Any action that you perform on your device will be replicated on your computer screen as well.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Life360 is probably among the top family locators for Android users. Apart from its extensive range of features, the app provides a user-friendly interface, which allows it easier for even elders to use the app without any issues. Even though there isn’t a dedicated Life360 software for Windows, you can follow the above-mentioned methods to run the <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>.</p><h2 id="You-Might-Also-Like"><a href="#You-Might-Also-Like" class="headerlink" title="You Might Also Like"></a>You Might Also Like</h2><h2 id="Location-based-apps"><a href="#Location-based-apps" class="headerlink" title="Location-based apps"></a>Location-based apps</h2><p>GPS spoof for dating apps</p><p>GPS spoof for social apps</p><p>Pokemon Go on PC</p><p>AR game tricks</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/virtual-location-horizontal.png"                      alt="virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Change Phone GPS Location Easily</strong></p><ul><li>● Teleport GPS location to anywhere</li><li>● Play AR games without moving</li><li>● Spoof Location on the popular Apps</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Try Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-stuck-on-downloading-of-itel-s23-7-ways-to-resolve-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Stuck on Downloading Of Itel S23? 7 Ways to Resolve | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-oppo-reno-10-pro-5g-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-vivo-v30-lite-5g-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Vivo V30 Lite 5G Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-11-best-location-changers-for-tecno-pova-6-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 11 Best Location Changers for Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-stuck-on-downloading-of-lava-blaze-2-7-ways-to-resolve-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Stuck on Downloading Of Lava Blaze 2? 7 Ways to Resolve | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-vivo-v27e-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Revive Your Bricked Vivo V27e in Minutes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-screen-unresponsive-heres-how-to-fix-it-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>OnePlus Nord N30 5G Screen Unresponsive?

It’s a powerful OS that gives you the utmost freedom and flexibility, allowing you to customize your phone to suit your needs.</p><p>However, regardless of the capabilities of Android phones and the features that come with their OS, just like any other smartphone, they’re prone to glitches and annoying issues – especially with their video files.</p><p>You may encounter <strong>videos not playing on your Vivo Y56 5G</strong> more frequently than you like. Whether it’s video files you’ve recorded using your phone or files you’ve downloaded, this glitch can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Fortunately, there are several solutions you could try to fix it.</p><p>See what you can do if <strong>videos won’t play on your Android.</strong></p><h2 id="Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android"><a href="#Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android" class="headerlink" title="Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?"></a>Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-2.jpg"                      alt="person recording cityscape using their android"                ></p><p>Considering how most smartphone manufacturers tend to emphasize the unbelievable quality of their cameras, perfect night modes, seamless slow-motion recordings, superb resolution, and more, you’d expect all images and videos to function flawlessly on your Android. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.</p><p>Occasionally, you could find that the videos you access from your gallery won’t play, sending you the message that “video cannot be played” or “can’t play video.” Other times, you might find that YouTube videos won’t load correctly or your downloaded videos won’t open in your media player.</p><p>There could be a wide variety of reasons that is happening, including:</p><ul><li>Corrupted video</li><li>Corrupted SD card</li><li>Outdated media player</li><li>Outdated OS</li><li>Incomplete download from the source</li><li>Low storage</li><li>Video downloaded from a suspicious source</li></ul><p>An array of hardware and software issues could lead to you being unable to play videos on your Android. However, that doesn’t mean you should immediately send your device for repairs or delete the videos that won’t play. There might be a few better solutions you could try.</p><h2 id="What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone"><a href="#What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone"></a>What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone</h2><p>Since there are many reasons for having problems with videos not playing on your Android, you could also try many solutions.</p><h3 id="1-Do-a-Factory-Reset"><a href="#1-Do-a-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Factory Reset"></a>1. Do a Factory Reset</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-3.jpg"                      alt="person holding a black android"                ></p><p>While a factory reset shouldn’t always be the first solution you go to, it can usually prove to be the most effective one.</p><p>A factory reset, aka a master reset or a hard reset, returns all your software configurations to the original state when the phone was first manufactured. In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-Vivo-Y56-5G"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Vivo-Y56-5G" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your Vivo Y56 5G"></a>2. Restart Your Vivo Y56 5G</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.</p><h3 id="4-Check-the-Internet-Connection"><a href="#4-Check-the-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="4. Check the Internet Connection"></a>4. Check the Internet Connection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg"                      alt="pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off"                ></p><p>If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.</p><p>Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.</p><p>You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset.

Gmail can smoothly perform in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. However, the browsers should be updated. So, please make sure that these browsers are running on the latest versions. Moreover, in case you use Chromebook, don’t forget to update the operating system in order to let it support Gmail.</p><h3 id="Clear-Cache-of-web-browser"><a href="#Clear-Cache-of-web-browser" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cache of web browser"></a>Clear Cache of web browser</h3><p>If you tried the above method but to no avail, try to clear the cache and cookies of the web browser.

When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:</p><ol><li>Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.</li><li>Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.</li><li>Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.</li></ol><p>Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.</p><h3 id="Check-Attachments"><a href="#Check-Attachments" class="headerlink" title="Check Attachments"></a>Check Attachments</h3><p>Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.</p><h2 id="Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue"><a href="#Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue"></a>Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue</h2><p>Many times, the users get the error that says “Account not synced” while they try to work with Gmail.

It’s a powerful OS that gives you the utmost freedom and flexibility, allowing you to customize your phone to suit your needs.</p><p>However, regardless of the capabilities of Android phones and the features that come with their OS, just like any other smartphone, they’re prone to glitches and annoying issues – especially with their video files.</p><p>You may encounter <strong>videos not playing on your Samsung Galaxy A24</strong> more frequently than you like. Whether it’s video files you’ve recorded using your phone or files you’ve downloaded, this glitch can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Fortunately, there are several solutions you could try to fix it.</p><p>See what you can do if <strong>videos won’t play on your Android.</strong></p><h2 id="Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android"><a href="#Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android" class="headerlink" title="Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?"></a>Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-2.jpg"                      alt="person recording cityscape using their android"                ></p><p>Considering how most smartphone manufacturers tend to emphasize the unbelievable quality of their cameras, perfect night modes, seamless slow-motion recordings, superb resolution, and more, you’d expect all images and videos to function flawlessly on your Android. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.</p><p>Occasionally, you could find that the videos you access from your gallery won’t play, sending you the message that “video cannot be played” or “can’t play video.” Other times, you might find that YouTube videos won’t load correctly or your downloaded videos won’t open in your media player.</p><p>There could be a wide variety of reasons that is happening, including:</p><ul><li>Corrupted video</li><li>Corrupted SD card</li><li>Outdated media player</li><li>Outdated OS</li><li>Incomplete download from the source</li><li>Low storage</li><li>Video downloaded from a suspicious source</li></ul><p>An array of hardware and software issues could lead to you being unable to play videos on your Android. However, that doesn’t mean you should immediately send your device for repairs or delete the videos that won’t play. There might be a few better solutions you could try.</p><h2 id="What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone"><a href="#What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone"></a>What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone</h2><p>Since there are many reasons for having problems with videos not playing on your Android, you could also try many solutions.</p><h3 id="1-Do-a-Factory-Reset"><a href="#1-Do-a-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Factory Reset"></a>1. Do a Factory Reset</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-3.jpg"                      alt="person holding a black android"                ></p><p>While a factory reset shouldn’t always be the first solution you go to, it can usually prove to be the most effective one.</p><p>A factory reset, aka a master reset or a hard reset, returns all your software configurations to the original state when the phone was first manufactured. In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-A24"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-A24" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your Samsung Galaxy A24"></a>2. Restart Your Samsung Galaxy A24</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.</p><h3 id="4-Check-the-Internet-Connection"><a href="#4-Check-the-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="4. Check the Internet Connection"></a>4. Check the Internet Connection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg"                      alt="pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off"                ></p><p>If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.</p><p>Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.</p><p>You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network settings &gt; Reset settings</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-6.jpg"                      alt="android network reset"                ></p><h3 id="5-Clear-the-Cache"><a href="#5-Clear-the-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Clear the Cache"></a>5. Clear the Cache</h3><p>The cache stores a copy of your most commonly used data, helping decrease loading time and improve your phone’s performance. However, too much cache data can take up too much space and cause data corruption, preventing you from accessing some of your apps.</p><p>On average, you should clear your phone’s cache every few months to ensure that everything runs smoothly. If you encounter issues with your videos not playing on Android, clearing the cache could be just the fix you need.</p><p>To clear the cache from your apps, you’ll want to go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps.</strong> From there, select the app you want to remove the cache from, scroll down to <strong>Storage</strong>, then choose <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-7.jpg"                      alt="clear cache on android apps"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Android-OS"><a href="#6-Update-Android-OS" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Android OS"></a>6. Update Android OS</h3><p>An outdated Android OS is usually the culprit behind many bugs and glitches you may encounter on your phone. It can prevent you from playing video files, accessing apps, taking photos, and more. It can lead to data corruption and loss, expose you to malware and cyberattacks, and compromise phone performance.</p><p>Regularly updating your OS to its latest version is always in your best interest.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Reset Android to factory settings"></a>4. Reset Android to factory settings</h3><p>If the previous methods don’t work, you might need to do a <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html"><u>factory reset on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G</u></a>. But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.</li></ul><p>Please be mindful that performing a factory reset on Android will reset your Android completely to its initial state.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-4.jpg"                      alt="Perform a factory reset on Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software"></a>Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software</h2><p><strong>Missing app icons on Android</strong> can sometimes be a result of errors in your Android system launcher, causing inconvenience and potential disruptions to your device’s operation.

Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Settings</strong>in the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg"                      alt="settings in spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap <strong>Log Out</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg"                      alt="log out of spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Log In</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-6.jpg"                      alt="log into spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter your login credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap <strong>Login</strong>again, and you’re in.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-7.jpg"                      alt="re-login to spotify with your credentials"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h3><p>Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-8.jpg"                      alt="restart android to fix spotify crashing"                ></p><h3 id="5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date"><a href="#5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date" class="headerlink" title="5. Set Up Your Time and Date"></a>5. Set Up Your Time and Date</h3><p>Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>on your Android.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong>or <strong>General Management</strong> (depending on your Android model).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to <strong>Date and Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Set Date</strong>and set the correct date.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-9.jpg"                      alt="set date on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to <strong>Set Time</strong>and set the right time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg"                      alt="set time on android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Your-System-Software"><a href="#6-Update-Your-System-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Your System Software"></a>6. Update Your System Software</h3><p>Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated.

Sometimes, it’s even more frustrating than a physically broken screen because you don’t know where the issue is coming from.</p><p>If your <strong>touchscreen is malfunctioning</strong> or doesn’t work correctly, you cannot interact with your device. On this page, you’ll learn general <strong>phone touch problems</strong> on Android and how to get rid of them. Now explore the article to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg"                      alt="android screen problems intro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-My-Android-Experiencing-Touch-Screen-Problems"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-My-Android-Experiencing-Touch-Screen-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems"></a>Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems</h2><p>Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.</p><ul><li>The <strong>touchscreen problem</strong>freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.</li><li>Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.</li><li>Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).</li><li>The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.</li><li>It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.</li><li>The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.</li><li>Outdated devices are prone to the black&#x2F;white&#x2F;blue screen of death.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Tips-Fixes-and-Workarounds-To-Fix-Your-Lava-Yuva-3-Touch-Problems"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-Fixes-and-Workarounds-To-Fix-Your-Lava-Yuva-3-Touch-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Lava Yuva 3 Touch Problems"></a>Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Lava Yuva 3 Touch Problems</h2><p>If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your <strong>touch screen malfunctioning,</strong> here are some solutions to fix it.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Remove-the-Screen-Protector-and-Phone-Case"><a href="#Method-1-Remove-the-Screen-Protector-and-Phone-Case" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case"></a>Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case</h3><p>Some phone cases and screen protectors cause <strong>touch problems</strong> on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a <strong>touchscreen problem</strong> on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg"                      alt="android restart method"                ></p><p>To restart your Android, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the <strong>Power</strong> button as well as the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button at the same time.</p><h3 id="Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android"></a>Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android</h3><p>Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Backup and Reset.</strong> Next, tap on <strong>Factory data reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete all</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg"                      alt="android factory data reset"                ></p><p>Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode"></a>Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode</h3><p>If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Placing your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Lava Yuva 3.</p><p><strong>Step 1A</strong>: Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button and <strong>Volume Down</strong> buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1B</strong>: If your Lava Yuva 3 still has a <strong>Home</strong> button, press and hold the <strong>Home</strong> button and the <strong>Power</strong> button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1C</strong>: If step 1A did not put your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the <strong>Volume</strong> buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset, and confirm your choice with the <strong>Power</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 02"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for the process to complete and for your Lava Yuva 3 to restart automatically.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen"><a href="#Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen"></a>Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen</h3><p>If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the <strong>touchscreen problem,</strong> it could be the screen itself.

This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.</p><p>Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions</p><p>Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos.

How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone</h2><p>How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Sony Xperia 1 V device and halt it before the Sony Xperia 1 V device disables itself.</p><p>Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:</strong> Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer’s warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.</li><li>**Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system’s built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.</li><li>**Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.</li><li><strong>Backup your phone data regularly:</strong> Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.</li><li><strong>Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:</strong> Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is certainly upsetting when your gadget bricks, but you may attempt the solutions listed above to resolve the issue.

Then follow the steps given below:</p><p>Step 1: Launch the application and choose the System Repair option from the main interface. Connect your Infinix GT 10 Pro to the computer and choose the Android Repair mode, and hit the Start button to begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="fix android not receiving texts with Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will have to provide information about your device, including the brand, name, model, country, and carrier. In between, you will be notified that your device repair might erase the existing data of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="android not receiving texts - provide info"                ></p><p>Step 3: Agree with the conditions and hit the Next button. The software will download the firmware package automatically. It might take a while to finish the download, and when it is finished, the repair process will be initiated automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-8.png"                      alt="android not receiving texts - download firmware"                ></p><p>It won’t take long, and your Infinix GT 10 Pro will be repaired. Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Infinix GT 10 Pro is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Infinix GT 10 Pro phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Infinix GT 10 Pros because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Infinix GT 10 Pro is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Infinix GT 10 Pro is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Infinix GT 10 Pro device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Infinix GT 10 Pro, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p>_Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can’t even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.</p><h2 id="Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone"><a href="#Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone"></a>Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone</h2><p>If the Infinix GT 10 Pro phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue.
