If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Realme 11 Pro phone is to check your network connection.

If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Realme 11 Pro is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Realme 11 Pro device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Realme 11 Pro, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM.

Does a Cracked Screen Affect Touch on an Android?</h3><p>If you continue using a smartphone with a cracked screen, there are several implications. Your device will be vulnerable to further damage and might develop <strong>touchscreen problems</strong>,and your sensors will gradually begin to malfunction.

How Do I Temporarily Fix a Cracked Screen?</h3><p>If you can’t take your cracked screen to a repair shop, apply a small amount of vegetable oil or petroleum jelly to the screen.

If you can’t accommodate or don’t want a really large television, the TCL 50-inch Roku TV offers a decent middle ground that will appeal to shoppers who want an apartment or dorm-friendly TV without sacrificing quality.</p><p> In appearance, the TCL 50S425 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It’s black, rectangular, and slim. It comes with the option of wall-mounting or setting it up on a media console or other surface with the enclosed stand. With the legs attached, the set measures 44 inches wide, 28 inches tall, and 8 inches deep and weighs only 23.6 pounds. While the screen is categorized in the 50-inch class the size of the display is 49.5 inches on a diagonal. This lack of bulky bezels surrounding the screen contributes to the slim profile of this TV.</p><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV.</p><p> The Roku remote complements the streamlined design of the screen. In the style of other Roku remotes, it’s a compact and almost weightless wand-like infrared device with a simple and straightforward layout. We found it easy to hold in one hand and easily access all 20 buttons without having to make any grip adjustments. There are also a handful of shortcut buttons for quick access to Netflix, Hulu, the Roku Channel, and ESPN. As long as you point it directly toward the TV, you shouldn’t have any problems with remote performance, but we did notice an occasional lag here or there when the remote seemed to hang and then perform multiple actions in quick succession.</p><p> There are some unfortunate design quirks. The remote’s directional buttons are quite loud. They don’t require a hard press to activate, but they make an audible clicking sound. This is slightly jarring since the other buttons are nearly silent when pressed. Another drawback is the LED status indicator located in the bottom center of the display. By default this light is always on. You can turn this indicator off, but it will continue to blink and flash during other operations, which we sometimes found distracting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cT13RJhaMjC05v7eMym3vtM8M0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_05-70fc23cf6c2b4a13ac9d46f9372010ef.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Up and running in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Up and running in minutes</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 50-inch TCL Roku TV is a breeze. We opted to forego mounting the television, but the user manual indicates that this model is compatible with a VESA 200 x 200 wall mount with M6 x 12mm screws.</p><p> As directed, we placed the monitor face down on a plush surface and attached the two stand legs using the four MS x 25mm screws. After situating the television on a shelf, we plugged the unit into a wall outlet using the enclosed AC power cord. Once the TV was plugged in, it powered on immediately and displayed the guided setup process. These steps were very straightforward and included first setting a language preference, a network connection, and activating the device. The other critical step with setup involves either signing up for or logging into an existing Roku account.</p><p> Since we already had a Roku account, all of our previously selected channels and apps downloaded to the TV, which just took a few minutes, and then we were free to begin exploring. The amount of additional setup is pretty minimal. By default, you’ll see an HDR notification when you’re viewing HDR-enabled content, but you can turn this off from the settings panel if you like.</p><p> Additionally, if you plan to use a set-top cable box or antenna, the user manual offers straightforward instructions for doing so. You also have the option of enabling the Smart TV experience when you use antenna TV mode. This setting uses automatic content recognition (ACR) to make viewing recommendations based on what you view through your antenna or connected HDMI devices.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Clear-and-vivid-without-any-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Clear and vivid without any tweaking</strong></h2><p> One of the biggest draws of a 4K TV is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which offers four times the resolution quality of a standard high definition TV. This pixel resolution is also commonly referred to as Ultra HD (UHD). This Roku TV also comes with HDR, or High Dynamic Range, which is commonly bundled with 4K resolution in the newest smart TVs.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR improves image quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by intensifying the contrast between white and black areas on the screen while achieving a solid balance, so nothing looks too dark or too bright. It also broadens the palette of available colors, especially in combination with Wide Color Gamut (WCG).</p><p> One thing we noticed right out of the gate is how vivid 4K content looks. To test the 4K image quality, we started by exploring the 4K Spotlight content. This section includes links to 4K movies, TV, and videos. We found a couple of nature-themed 4K videos on YouTube and were really impressed with what we saw. A video touring Zion National Park looked almost 3D and we practically felt like we were there. The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> Apart from 4K nature videos, we also browsed 4K movies and TV shows through the Amazon Prime app. We found the same appealing mix of crisp picture quality, vibrant colors, and contrast. Even standard high definition shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime looked quite good on screen. Though it’s hard to say if there’s a considerable difference, TCL is eager to boast about the power of their 4K Creative Pro upscaling feature which renders regular HD content into 4K-like quality. The bottom line is that HD content looks great across the board, upscaled or not.</p><p> The colors pop in a vivid but not artificial way and yield realistic, even pristine, image quality.</p><p> With the handy multi-purpose asterisk button you can alter a number of display settings, and you can access this options menu in the middle of viewing content. Adjusting picture settings doesn’t require exiting an app or pausing whatever you’re watching, which lets you make adjustments and immediately see the result. You can add more vibrancy and contrast to whatever you’re watching, or enable modes like Movie when you’re viewing a film in the evening or with the lights dimmed.</p><p> You can control everything from backlighting to brightness, contrast, and dynamic contrast. This last setting is particularly relevant to HDR content because it helps balance the light and dark settings on your screen so that there’s no excess in either direction. The online user manual does a fine job of explaining some of the advanced picture settings, and even just toggling through the menu on the TV brings up a description of what you’re changing.</p><p> Regular picture mode and the predefined 4K HDR picture settings were on point, which made viewing right out of the box extremely easy and pleasant. We were also pleased by the picture quality from all angles. Getting too close or too far out to the right or left did reveal some shadows and distortion, but only at fairly extreme angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Lv4B9e6LaJSHW7NSl-Braa2vnmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_03-b8155781e440420aa0c6c2bf19f9fe6a.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Solid-but-not-spellbinding" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Solid but not spellbinding</strong></h2><p> While the TCL Roku TV offers impressive picture quality, the sound is less noteworthy. The two built-in 8-watt speakers offer decent volume levels, but there’s no advanced audio settings menu in this model. You do have control over aspects like sound mode and volume mode. The default sound mode is “normal,” which is appropriate for everyday viewing. But you can also select options for higher treble, more bass, movie, or music mode. As for volume modes, you can either turn on leveling, to balance the contrast between lows and highs in audio, or enable night mode, which sets a threshold for how high the volume can go.</p><p> We did notice some issues with what sounded like crackling and extreme lows and highs in dialog and music, though we were able to smooth these issues out by tweaking a few settings.</p><p> In our testing experience in a small room, the internal speakers were more than adequate without the need for additional speakers. If you do want another layer of dimension to your audio, you might consider opting for the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-speakers-and-home-theater-1846770" >wireless speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> designed specifically for Roku TV sets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oA3AbTZysdVWZbOWuuVGOa56_8c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW4061017_02-04183ae8dcd44b778b4da0e7706d5df2.jpg"                      alt="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868495/19272" target="_top" id="1868495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868495/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902309/19272" target="_top" id="1902309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902309/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-and-streamlined" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive and streamlined"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive and streamlined</strong></h2><p> Simplicity and quality are two of the greatest strengths of this TV and a big part of the equation is the operating system. The TCL 50S425 operates on Roku OS 9.1, and it’s extremely user-friendly. Updates are automatic so there’s no manual effort required on your part, and the interface is laid out in a clear and uncomplicated manner.</p><p> The Home screen features all of your apps, which you can arrange and delete with the click of the asterisk button. All the other menus are easy to identify as well. There’s a search page, a streaming channels section, and the settings menu. This clean and straightforward layout may not be the most sophisticated, but it’s easy to use and simplicity is the beauty of this system.</p><p> While the remote doesn’t come with a built-in speaker, the free Roku app does offer a voice-assistant feature. It’s best when completing a general search for a show or actor or for launching a particular app. If you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa enabled device, this Roku TV will support them, and they offer a generally better experience than using the Roku app voice remote function.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-A-great-bargain-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: A great bargain on a budget"></a><strong>Price: A great bargain on a budget</strong></h2><p> If you don’t want to spend a fortune on a 4K TV, but you want to get as much value as possible, the TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a compelling option. It retails for $350, which situates it in the growing and competitive class of 4K TVs under $500. In the TCL 4-Series alone you have several other models to consider that all share the same specifications except for size. The larger 55-inch TCL Roku TV retails for just $30 more than the 50-inch version and features a larger screen size of 54.6 inches. It may not seem considerable, but if you’re limited with space, the extra width and height (five and two inches, respectively) can actually feel like a pretty massive difference. And if you opt for a smaller display and a lower price tag, the 43-inch TCL Roku TV retails for about $280, but you’re sacrificing 7 inches of display.</p><h2 id="TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition"><a href="#TCL-50S425-50-inch-Roku-TV-2019-vs-Toshiba-55LF711U20-55-inch-Fire-TV-Edition" class="headerlink" title="TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"></a><strong>TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV (2019) vs. Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition</strong></h2><p> The TCL 50-inch Roku TV is not without external competitors either. The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition retails for about $100 more and runs on the Fire OS, which stands toe-to-toe with the Roku platform with access to over 500,000 shows and movies. The Toshiba Fire TV comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, an edge for shoppers who want the ease of a voice assistant built right into the remote. But the Roku TV supports both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as voice control through the Roku<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> While the Toshiba TV is in the 55-inch class, the screen size is actually the same as the Roku TV. The former, however is visibly taller, wider, and bulkier. The Toshiba Fire TV does havea slight advantage when it comes to audio quality. The sound can get quite loud and full-bodied, thanks to two 10-watt speakers and DTS Studio Sound&#x2F;DTS TruSurround. On the other hand, the picture quality may not be as impressive as the Roku TV, which really doesn’t require a lot of tweaking to enjoy. And if you’re a fan of the simple Roku interface, you may find the Fire OS dashboard to be a bit cluttered.</p><p> Browse our other recommendations on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >best smart TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and best TVs under $500.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/toshiba-55lf711u20-55-inch-fire-tv-edition-review-4772221" >Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A budget-friendly 4K TV that offers impressive picture and overall value.</strong></p><p> The TCL 50S425 50-inch Roku TV is a smart 4K TV that possesses many merits: an appealing price point, excellent 4K HDR picture quality, a size profile that won’t overwhelm small rooms or apartments, and an easy-to-use interface that requires little fuss.

It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Honor X9a has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Honor X9a functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886073/19272" target="_top" id="1886073">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886073" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886073/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Honor X9a, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123901/26106" target="_top" id="2123901">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123901" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123901/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Honor X9a when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Honor X9a to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Honor X9a device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Honor X9a to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Honor X9a could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Honor X9a:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery-1"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Honor X9a when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Honor X9a to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device-1"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery!

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Infinix Smart 8 device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Infinix Smart 8 device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Infinix Smart 8 device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Infinix Smart 8 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Infinix Smart 8, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Infinix Smart 8 device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system.

If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache.

There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Infinix Smart 8 device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Infinix Smart 8, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”.

If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-04.jpg"                      alt="phone with damaged screen from dropping"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> If you have a screen protector or case, remove them because they can interfere with the process. This step will allow you to get a clear view of the screen and accurately assess the <strong><strong>dead pixel on the phone</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-05.jpg"                      alt="smartphone and a screen protector"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the <strong><strong>broken pixels on the phone</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing <strong><strong>dead pixels on the phone</strong></strong>. You can use a microfiber cloth to clean your screen gently, making sure not to apply too much pressure or use any harsh chemicals that could damage the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-06.jpg"                      alt="wiping phone screen with clean cloth"                ></p><h3 id="Option-2-Restart-Your-Infinix-Smart-8"><a href="#Option-2-Restart-Your-Infinix-Smart-8" class="headerlink" title="Option 2: Restart Your Infinix Smart 8"></a>Option 2: Restart Your Infinix Smart 8</h3><p>This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem. Here is how you restart most smartphones available in the market.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Press and hold down the <strong><strong>power key</strong></strong> on your Infinix Smart 8 until the <strong><strong>power menu</strong></strong> appears.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select <strong><strong>Restart</strong></strong> on your phone’s screen. It will initiate a reboot of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-07.jpg"                      alt="android interface restart and power off"                ></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong></p><p>If your Infinix Smart 8 is unresponsive to the usual restart method because a <strong><strong>part of the phone screen is not working</strong></strong>, try a forced restart by holding the <strong><strong>power button</strong></strong> for at least 10 seconds.</p><h3 id="Option-3-Check-If-Stuck-Infinix-Smart-8-Phone-Only-Appears-in-Specific-Mobile-Apps"><a href="#Option-3-Check-If-Stuck-Infinix-Smart-8-Phone-Only-Appears-in-Specific-Mobile-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Option 3: Check If Stuck Infinix Smart 8 Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps"></a>Option 3: Check If Stuck Infinix Smart 8 Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps</h3><p>If the previous method did not work, check if the <strong><strong>stuck pixels on the phone</strong></strong> only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Put your smartphone in <strong><strong>Safe Mode</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Visit the help page for your device’s manufacturer to learn how to activate and deactivate safe mode. Safe mode disables all downloaded programs momentarily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg"                      alt="safe mode on the android screen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the <strong><strong>stuck pixel phone</strong></strong> display. Next, turn off <strong><strong>Safe Mode</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.</p><h3 id="Option-4-Perform-Factory-Data-Reset"><a href="#Option-4-Perform-Factory-Data-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset"></a>Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset</h3><p>Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Open the <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose <strong><strong>System &gt; Reset &gt; Erase all data (factory reset) &gt; Erase all data</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg"                      alt="smartphone reset settings"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>It is crucial to wait for the system to finish deleting all data during the factory data reset.

Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.</p><h3 id="1-Can-Dead-Infinix-Smart-8s-Fix-Themselves"><a href="#1-Can-Dead-Infinix-Smart-8s-Fix-Themselves" class="headerlink" title="1. Can Dead Infinix Smart 8s Fix Themselves?"></a>1. Can Dead Infinix Smart 8s Fix Themselves?</h3><p>No, a <strong><strong>dead pixel on the phone</strong></strong> is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.</p><h3 id="2-Can-Dead-Infinix-Smart-8s-Worsen"><a href="#2-Can-Dead-Infinix-Smart-8s-Worsen" class="headerlink" title="2. Can Dead Infinix Smart 8s Worsen?"></a>2. Can Dead Infinix Smart 8s Worsen?</h3><p>Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a <strong><strong>dead pixel on the phone</strong></strong> does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.</p><h3 id="3-Why-Are-Dead-Infinix-Smart-8s-Spreading-on-My-Infinix-Smart-8"><a href="#3-Why-Are-Dead-Infinix-Smart-8s-Spreading-on-My-Infinix-Smart-8" class="headerlink" title="3. Why Are Dead Infinix Smart 8s Spreading on My Infinix Smart 8?"></a>3. Why Are Dead Infinix Smart 8s Spreading on My Infinix Smart 8?</h3><p>It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced <strong><strong>dead pixels on your phone</strong></strong>. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.</p><h3 id="4-How-Many-Stuck-Infinix-Smart-8s-Are-Acceptable"><a href="#4-How-Many-Stuck-Infinix-Smart-8s-Are-Acceptable" class="headerlink" title="4.

How Many Stuck Infinix Smart 8s Are Acceptable?</h3><p>It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.</p><p>In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Infinix Smart 8 devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You have learned the difference between a stuck and <strong><strong>dead pixel on the phone</strong></strong>.

This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Honor X50i device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Honor X50i device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Honor X50i device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Honor X50i contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Honor X50i device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Honor X50i device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Honor-X50i-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Honor-X50i-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Honor X50i is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Honor X50i is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Honor X50i is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Honor X50is.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Honor X50i is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Honor X50i device. So if your Honor X50i is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Honor X50i device’s animation type and speed on your Honor X50i via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Honor X50i to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Honor X50i is running slow and freezing, the Honor X50i device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time.

When in Safe Mode, the Itel S23 device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won’t run. Here’s how you can boot your Itel S23 into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Power Off Your Device</strong></p><p>Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Safe Mode</strong></p><p>To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:</p><ul><li>For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer’s logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Itel S23 device finishes booting. You should see “Safe Mode” displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.</li><li>Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Itel S23 device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Itel S23.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

Why Is Your Oppo K11x Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Oppo K11x Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Oppo K11x has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Oppo K11x functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135356/19272" target="_top" id="2135356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135356/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Oppo K11x, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Oppo K11x when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Oppo K11x to switch off and on again.

All our important information, such as photos, videos, audio files, documents, notes, calendars, emails, etc, are stored on our phones. This causes a major storage&#x2F;space problem in our phones and <strong>a shortage of storage space</strong> is one of the main reasons why an App won’t open or why all Apps won’t open on your Oppo K11x. To see how much of your storage space is occupied by Apps, go to “Settings” and select “Application Manager”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984182929893.jpg"                      alt="Application Manager"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583143306.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Another possible reason for Apps to crash or why an App won’t open is a possible data crash.

Update the App</p><p>It is always advisable to keep your Android software as well as your Apps up-to-date and you must constantly check for any updates which may be available in the Google Play Store.</p><p>Follow the steps given below to update the app which won’t open on your phone:</p><p>• Visit Google Play Store on your Oppo K11x.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583996008.jpg"                      alt="Visit Google Play Store"                ></p><p>• Now select “My Apps &amp; Games” from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183627979.jpg"                      alt="select “My Apps &amp; Games"                ></p><p>• In this step, you may click on “Update All” to update all Apps for which an update is available or manually select the Apps which you wish to Update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183782889.jpg"                      alt="Update All"                ></p><p>Once the App is updated, close all Apps and tabs running in the background.

It is terrible that you can’t install App on your device. But in this article, you will know more about the causes behind this error and the best ways to fix it, read on, here is all you need to know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error"><a href="#Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error"></a>Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error</h2><p>You may ask: Why can’t I download apps on my Oppo K11x? Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Oppo K11x device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Oppo K11x device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Oppo K11x or tablet?

As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-X50-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Honor-X50-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Honor X50 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Honor X50 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Honor X50 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Honor X50 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Honor X50, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Honor X50 when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Honor X50 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Honor X50 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Honor X50 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Honor X50 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Honor X50:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone.

It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out.

We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.</p><p>Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn’t help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> happens and explore solutions that work for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android"></a>Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android</h2><p>First of all, what does <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> mean? To answer this question, it’s essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.</p><p>SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user’s device and a website’s server.</p><p>The error message appears when there’s a problem with the SSL&#x2F;TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user’s device and the server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Your connection is not private error on Android."                ></p><p>Some common factors that could trigger the <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;</strong></li></ol><p>Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;</strong></li></ol><p>This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>No HTTPS enforcement;</strong></li></ol><p>Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn’t turn on the “force HTTPS” option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.</p><p>So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.</p><p>Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That’s why when you get the “your connection is not private” message on Android, you can’t access the website.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean"><a href="#Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean"></a>Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean</h2><p>When <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong> shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.</p><ol><li><strong>ERR_CERT_SYMANTEC_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate</strong></li></ol><p>This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.</p><p>As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website’s SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate</strong></li></ol><p>The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID: Date and time mismatch</strong></li></ol><p>This error code points to a discrepancy between your Honor X9b’s date and time settings and the information on the website’s SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device’s date and time settings should resolve this issue.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem</strong></li></ol><p>This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website’s SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue.

This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-C67-4G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Realme-C67-4G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Realme C67 4G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Realme C67 4G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Realme C67 4G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Realme C67 4G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037356/7443" target="_top" id="2037356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037356/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Realme C67 4G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Realme C67 4G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027181/19272" target="_top" id="2027181">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027181" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027181/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Oppo A38. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Oppo A38 or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Oppo A38&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896555/19272" target="_top" id="1896555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896555/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Oppo A38 reset button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094429/7443" target="_top" id="2094429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094429/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Oppo A38 Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly.

We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem.

The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Oppo A38 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Oppo A38 device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Oppo A38 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Oppo A38 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Oppo A38 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo S18 Pro. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Vivo S18 Pro or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Vivo S18 Pro&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Vivo S18 Pro reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Vivo S18 Pro Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Lava Yuva 2 Pro. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Lava Yuva 2 Pro or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Lava Yuva 2 Pro&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049391/7443" target="_top" id="2049391">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049391" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049391/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Lava Yuva 2 Pro reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Lava Yuva 2 Pro Account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg"                      alt="webview crash google app"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Slow Loading Times</strong></li></ul><p>Slow loading times can also be a sign of an impending crash. If webpages within the app take unusually long to load or images and other content appear pixelated or distorted, it could be a sign that Lava Yuva 2 Pro Android System WebView is struggling to handle the workload.</p><p>But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Updates and Compatibility Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Updates are often intended to improve software stability and compatibility, but in some cases, they can introduce new bugs or compatibility issues that lead to crashes. It is particularly evident when app developers and WebView developers release updates that don’t fully align, causing conflicts.</p><ul><li><strong>Insufficient Memory</strong></li></ul><p>Lava Yuva 2 Pro Android System WebView requires a certain amount of memory to operate properly. If your device is running low on memory, it can cause Lava Yuva 2 Pro Android System WebView to crash. It is more likely to happen on older devices with less RAM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-03.jpg"                      alt="webview crash out of memory message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Outdated Lava Yuva 2 Pro Android System WebView</strong></li></ul><p>The WebView app is responsible for rendering web content within Android apps. Using an outdated version of WebView can introduce known bugs and security vulnerabilities that can cause crashes.</p><ul><li><strong>Conflicts With Other Apps</strong></li></ul><p>WebView might crash if it conflicts with other resources or processes running on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device. It can happen if the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device runs low on memory or other resource-intensive apps compete for system resources.</p><p>In the next section, you’ll explore potential solutions to keep your apps running smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Android-WebView-Crashes-Here-Are-Quick-and-Proven-Solutions"><a href="#Part-2-Android-WebView-Crashes-Here-Are-Quick-and-Proven-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Android WebView Crashes?

This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886069/19272" target="_top" id="1886069">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886069" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886069/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Honor 90. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Settings</strong>in the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg"                      alt="settings in spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap <strong>Log Out</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg"                      alt="log out of spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Log In</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-6.jpg"                      alt="log into spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter your login credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap <strong>Login</strong>again, and you’re in.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-7.jpg"                      alt="re-login to spotify with your credentials"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h3><p>Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Honor 90 device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-8.jpg"                      alt="restart android to fix spotify crashing"                ></p><h3 id="5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date"><a href="#5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date" class="headerlink" title="5. Set Up Your Time and Date"></a>5. Set Up Your Time and Date</h3><p>Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>on your Android.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong>or <strong>General Management</strong> (depending on your Android model).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to <strong>Date and Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Set Date</strong>and set the correct date.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-9.jpg"                      alt="set date on android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136616/26400" target="_top" id="2136616">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136616" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136616/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to <strong>Set Time</strong>and set the right time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg"                      alt="set time on android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Your-System-Software"><a href="#6-Update-Your-System-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Your System Software"></a>6. Update Your System Software</h3><p>Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated. Try updating it to the latest version to try and fix the crashing problem. The steps for the Android system update are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-11.jpg"                      alt="settings on your android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong> or <strong>About Phone</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-12.jpg"                      alt="about phone to find system update"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>System Update</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If there’s an available update, tap</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-13.jpg"                      alt="install system update on android"                ></p><h3 id="7-Update-Your-App"><a href="#7-Update-Your-App" class="headerlink" title="7. Update Your App"></a>7. Update Your App</h3><p>If your system is updated, then Spotify might need an update. The app might malfunction if you’re using an older version. Thus, updating the app might solve the Spotify crashing problem. You can update Spotify by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the <strong>Play Store</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-14.jpg"                      alt="play store on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search and open Spotify in the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap Update</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-15.jpg"                      alt="update spotify on android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Free-up-Storage"><a href="#8-Free-up-Storage" class="headerlink" title="8. Free up Storage"></a>8. Free up Storage</h3><p>Spotify can start crashing if your Android’s storage space is at capacity. That can also cause other apps to crash, not only Spotify. Therefore, check the storage space and free up as much as possible. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Device Maintenance &gt; Storage</strong>or go directly to Storage.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg"                      alt="storage in settings on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Here, you can see how much of your storage space is available and what’s taking up the most space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-17.jpg"                      alt="available storage on android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948949/19272" target="_top" id="1948949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, you can go ahead and clear as much space as you can.</li></ul><h3 id="9-Reinstall-Spotify"><a href="#9-Reinstall-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="9. Reinstall Spotify"></a>9. Reinstall Spotify</h3><p>There’s another solution if the Spotify app keeps crashing. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling it again on your Android. That will reset the app and might solve your problem. Follow the next steps to reinstall Spotify:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the Spotify app on your Android.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold the app icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Then, press <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-18.jpg"                      alt="uninstall spotify on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Press <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, open the PlayStore and find Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap <strong>Install</strong>to reinstall the app again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-19.jpg"                      alt="reinstall spotify on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Once it installs, log in to test if it’s working.</li></ul><h3 id="10-Check-if-Spotify-Is-Down"><a href="#10-Check-if-Spotify-Is-Down" class="headerlink" title="10. Check if Spotify Is Down"></a>10. Check if Spotify Is Down</h3><p>If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your web browser.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type “<strong>Is Spotify down</strong>” in the search bar.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg"                      alt="search if spotify is down"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> You’ll see several websites that check real-time app servers and if they’re down.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg"                      alt="spotify server up or down"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to one or two and see what they say.

Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg"                      alt="settings on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find <strong>Spotify</strong> and tap it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-23.jpg"                      alt="spotify in settings on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Storage</strong>or <strong>Storage usage</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-24.jpg"                      alt="spotify storage usage on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-25.jpg"                      alt="clear spotify cache on android"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your Spotify app keeps crashing, several reasons might be behind it.

This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

There are good chances that some users do not modify their WiFi network name and possibly, your neighbor may have the same WiFi network, service provider. Therefore, ensure you connect to the correct WiFi network.</p><h3 id="Reset-the-Wifi-network"><a href="#Reset-the-Wifi-network" class="headerlink" title="Reset the Wifi network"></a>Reset the Wifi network</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to fix the authentication problem of Wifi is to reset the network. To do this, you would be required to forget the respective network first and then connect to it again. This can be done by simply following these steps.</p><p>1. Firstly, you need to forget a Wifi network. To do it, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; WiFi and network. From here, you can see a list of all the Wifi hotspots that your phone connects to. Select the network you wish to forget.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981516957952.jpg"                      alt="Select the network"                ></p><p>2. When you would select a network, it will provide the basic information related to it. Just tap on the “Forget” button and agree to the pop-up message. This will erase the network’s information from your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981517891308.jpg"                      alt="tap on the “Forget”"                ></p><p>3. Afterward, turn on your Wifi again and tap to the network you wish to connect to. Simply provide the credentials and tap on the “Connect” button to reestablish the connection. This way, you can reset the network successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981518275903.jpg"                      alt="tap on the Connect button"                ></p><h3 id="Modify-network-connection"><a href="#Modify-network-connection" class="headerlink" title="Modify network connection"></a>Modify network connection</h3><p>If the above solution won’t work, then you would be required to walk the extra mile to fix the Motorola Moto G84 5G Wifi problem. After you reset a network connection, if still getting issues regarding the authentication of the network, you need to modify the connection. In this technique, you will be changing the IP settings on your phone to alter the way it establishes a secure connection. You can do it by following these steps.</p><p>1. To start with, visit your phone’s Settings and open the Wifi page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981518727215.jpg"                      alt="open the Wifi page"                ></p><p>2. This will display a list of all the Wifi networks that are associated with your device. Just long-tap on the Wifi network that you wish to modify. It will open another pop-up window. From here, tap on the option of “Manage network settings”. Sometimes, users also get an option of “Modify network settings” here as well. Simply select it to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981519057338.jpg"                      alt="Modify network settings"                ></p><p>3. It will display basic information related to your Wifi network. Just tap on the “Show advanced options” button to access more options related to the network setting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981519311624.jpg"                      alt="Show advanced options"                ></p><p>4. From the IP Settings menu, change the field from DHCP to Static. This will let you establish a static connection between your device and the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981520827015.jpg"                      alt="change the field"                ></p><p>5. As soon as you will change it to static, you will get different fields related to your network’s IP address, gateway, DNS, and more. Simply fill these fields and tap on the “Save” button once you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521159129.jpg"                      alt="fill these fields"                ></p><p>Now, try to connect to the Wifi hotspot again. You would be able to overcome the authentication problem of Wifi.</p><h3 id="Change-Network-Security-Type"><a href="#Change-Network-Security-Type" class="headerlink" title="Change Network Security Type"></a>Change Network Security Type</h3><p>It has been observed that, when we connect to Wifi, our device chooses a wrong security type. This clashes with the default security protocol of the router and authentication error occurred due to this. If your device is facing the same issue, then it can be fixed by simply changing its security type. To do this, follow these instructions:</p><p>1. To change the security type of a network, you need to “Add the network”. If you already have the Wifi network saved, then simply forget the network by following the above-mentioned tutorial.</p><p>2. Now, turn on your device’s Wifi and tap on the option of “Add network”. Here, you would be asked to give a network name and select the security type. To manually select it, tap on the “Security” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521984185.jpg"                      alt="tap on the “Security”"                ></p><p>3. From here, you will get a list of various security protocols that you can pick. Select “WPA&#x2F;WPA2-PSK” and save your selection.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981522445076.jpg" alt="Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK”"></p><p>Now, try to connect to the network again.
