Common Causes</h2><p>Experiencing a <strong>cell phone blank screen</strong> is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A <strong>phone screen not turning on</strong> happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why <strong>your phone screen went black but still works.</strong></p><h3 id="A-Drained-Battery"><a href="#A-Drained-Battery" class="headerlink" title="A Drained Battery"></a>A Drained Battery</h3><p>The first thing that comes to mind when your <strong>phone screen suddenly goes black</strong> is you have a drained battery. Even though this is obvious, it’s still important to mention, as this is usually what most people encounter. To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-02.jpg"                      alt="drained iphone battery"                ></p><h3 id="App-Troubles"><a href="#App-Troubles" class="headerlink" title="App Troubles"></a>App Troubles</h3><p>If your <strong>phone is working, but the screen is black,</strong> there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application.

Wipe the Cache of Your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Device"></a>Solution 4. Wipe the Cache of Your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Device</h3><p>A common reason for <strong><strong>Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Nord being stuck on the loading screen</strong></strong> is the filled cache partition. If you do not clean out the cache partition of your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device, its performance will degrade. As a result, your device will experience issues like the touch screen not working or getting stuck at the loading screen. Here is how you can clear the cache of your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Turn off your device by pressing and holding the “Power” button. Once it is turned off, press and hold the “Power” and “Volume Down” buttons until you see the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G logo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/fix-oneplus-touchscreen-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="wait for oneplus logo"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Now, enter your phone’s PIN or pattern and choose a language. After selecting the language, choose “Wipe data and cache.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/fix-oneplus-touchscreen-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="choose wipe data and cache option"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Select “Wipe cache” on the next screen and confirm the action through “Yes” in the ensuing window. Once the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/fix-oneplus-touchscreen-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="select wipe cache option"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-5-Reset-to-Factory-Settings"><a href="#Solution-5-Reset-to-Factory-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Solution 5. Reset to Factory Settings"></a>Solution 5. Reset to Factory Settings</h3><p>Sometimes, clearing the cache partition doesn’t help resolve the touchscreen issue. In that case, You have to factory reset your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device. It is the best and last solution if other fixes haven’t worked and you can’t pinpoint the reason. Factory resetting your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G will delete all phone data. Thus, you should create a proper backup before trying this fix. Follow these steps to factory reset your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G in no time:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Launch Settings on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device and tap “System” to select “Reset Options.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/fix-oneplus-touchscreen-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="select reset options"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> In the “Reset Options,” select “Erase all data (factory reset)” and confirm the action by again pressing “Erase All Data.” It will start the factory reset process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/fix-oneplus-touchscreen-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="start the erase process"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-6-Replace-the-Old-Screen-with-A-New-Screen"><a href="#Solution-6-Replace-the-Old-Screen-with-A-New-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Solution 6. Replace the Old Screen with A New Screen"></a>Solution 6. Replace the Old Screen with A New Screen</h3><p>If none of the above-mentioned fixes have worked so far, you should replace the touch screen. Replacing the touch screen is recommended in case of hardware and severe software issues. However, it can be quite an expensive fix as new touch screens aren’t cheap. The prices for new touchscreens differ depending on the model. These prices start from $20 and go up to hundreds of dollars.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Avoid-Samsung-Galaxy-F15-5G-Screen-being-Unresponsive"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Avoid-Samsung-Galaxy-F15-5G-Screen-being-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Avoid Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Screen being Unresponsive?"></a>Part 3: How to Avoid Samsung Galaxy F15 5G Screen being Unresponsive?</h2><p>Protecting your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device against system issues like touch not working is not difficult.

It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Samsung Galaxy F14 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Samsung Galaxy F14 5G screens to become unresponsive.

For instance, Samsung Galaxy F14 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><h2 id="The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Samsung-Galaxy-F14-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Samsung-Galaxy-F14-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="The Common Solutions To Solve A Samsung Galaxy F14 5G Screen Unresponsive"></a>The Common Solutions To Solve A Samsung Galaxy F14 5G Screen Unresponsive</h2><p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Samsung Galaxy F14 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Samsung Galaxy F14 5G, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM.

Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Samsung Galaxy F14 5G keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone"></a>Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone</h2><p>As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html" >Samsung Galaxy F14 5G S22 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

Sometimes, it’s the phone that’s causing a problem, so to resolve it, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Firstly, unlock your phone. Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, select the ‘Reboot’ option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="select reboot option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check Router Settings"></a>Fix 2: Check Router Settings</h3><p>If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings. This is because your phone might be blocked from connecting to the network, and if this is the scenario, your phone will never maintain the connection. You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg"                      alt="check router settings"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network"><a href="#Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reconnect to Network"></a>Fix 3: Reconnect to Network</h3><p>To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the ‘Forget Network’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg"                      alt="click on forgot network"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg"                      alt="enter wifi password"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Restart Your Router"></a>Fix 4: Restart Your Router</h3><p>As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg"                      alt="open wifi settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You will see a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you have connected to previously.

If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying.

It is a feature that will end any excessive background functioning of the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device. For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode. Since the important functions and the naïve apps will be running on the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device, you will get to know if it’s really a software glitch or not by running the Phone app in Safe mode.

Due to the constant usage, the temporary files get collected and may corrupt if not cleared. Hence, the next solution you should try when the Phone app keeps stopping is to clear the cache. Here are the steps to be performed.</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your device and go to “Application” or “Apps”.</li><li>Now from the list of all applications, go to “Phone” and tap on it.</li><li>Now, click on “Storage” and choose “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-phone.jpg"                      alt="Phone app crashing - clear cache"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Update-Google-Play-services"><a href="#2-3-Update-Google-Play-services" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Update Google Play services"></a>2.3 Update Google Play services</h3><p>Since Android is created by Google, there must be some Google Play services that are crucial to run several system functions. And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.</p><h3 id="2-4-Update-the-Samsung-Galaxy-F14-5G-firmware"><a href="#2-4-Update-the-Samsung-Galaxy-F14-5G-firmware" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Update the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G firmware"></a>2.4 Update the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G firmware</h3><p>When the firmware is not updated, it may conflict with some apps and maybe that’s why your Phone app falls prey.

Fix It Now"></a>Samsung Galaxy F14 5G Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do.

To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful.

That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days.

Ensuring that SIM is not wet either and then putting it back into its place. If this works, then the SIM not working in Android was due to the dirt or moisture that was preventing proper contact between SIM card pins and smartphone circuit.</p><h3 id="2-3-Insert-the-SIM-card-correctly"><a href="#2-3-Insert-the-SIM-card-correctly" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly"></a>2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly</h3><p>If your SIM card was working properly until yet, there is a good possibility that the SIM card may have moved a bit from its actual location. Eventually, there is poor contact between the SIM card pins and the circuit. Try inserting your SIM card properly with the following steps.</p><ul><li>Power off your Samsung Galaxy F04 and with the help of Q pin, eject the SIM card holder from the SIM slot of your device.</li><li>Now, grab a soft rubber pencil eraser and gently rub it in on the gold pins of SIM card to clean them properly. Then, with the help of a soft cloth wipe away the rubber residue from the SIM card.</li><li>Next, push the SIM back into the SIM card holder properly and push it back into the SIM slot now.</li><li>Turn your device back on and look if your SIM not provisioned on the Android issue is resolved or not.</li></ul><h3 id="2-4-Activate-the-SIM-card"><a href="#2-4-Activate-the-SIM-card" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Activate the SIM card"></a>2.4 Activate the SIM card</h3><p>Usually, when you buy a new SIM card, it gets automatically activated within 24 hours of being plugged into a new device. But if that’s not happening in your case and you’re wondering how to activate SIM card, make use of the three options below to enable activation:</p><ul><li>Call your carrier service provider</li><li>Send an SMS</li><li>Log on to your carrier’s website and look for the activation page over it.</li></ul><p>Note: The aforementioned options are straightforward and are quick ways to enable activation. It depends on your carrier network whether they support them.</p><h3 id="2-5-Contact-your-carrier"><a href="#2-5-Contact-your-carrier" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Contact your carrier"></a>2.5 Contact your carrier</h3><p>Even if your SIM isn’t activated, grab another working device to make a phone call to your carrier or network. Ensure, to explain the entire situation and the error message to them. Be patient while they investigate the issue. It may eat up a heck load of time or may get resolved in a few minutes that completely depend upon the complexity of the issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/contact-carrier.jpg"                      alt="fix SIM not working in android - contact carrier"                ></p><h3 id="2-6-Try-the-other-SIM-card-slot"><a href="#2-6-Try-the-other-SIM-card-slot" class="headerlink" title="2.6 Try the other SIM card slot"></a>2.6 Try the other SIM card slot</h3><p>A yet another reason why SIM not working in Android can be because of the SIM card slot might have gone corrupted. Thanks to the dual SIM technology, you do not have to rush immediately to get it to check or repair. You can simply rule out this possibility by ejecting the SIM card from its original SIM slot and then replacing it into the other SIM card slot. If this solution did work out for you then it is obvious that the problem was with the SIM card slot that got corrupted. And hence, it was triggering SIM not responding issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/insert-sim-properly.jpg"                      alt="fix SIM not responding - try another slot"                ></p><h3 id="2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones"><a href="#2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones" class="headerlink" title="2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones"></a>2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones</h3><p>Or just in case, you’ve still no joy and the SIM not provisioned on Android message is bothering you. Try making use of another Android device. Eject the SIM card from the Samsung Galaxy F04 device which is creating problems and try plugging it into other Samsung Galaxy F04] and other smartphones. Perhaps, this will let you know whether the issue is with your device only or with the SIM card itself.</p><h3 id="2-8-Try-a-new-SIM-card"><a href="#2-8-Try-a-new-SIM-card" class="headerlink" title="2.8 Try a new SIM card"></a>2.8 Try a new SIM card</h3><p>Still, wondering how to fix SIM not provisioned? Perhaps, nothing worked for you, right? Well, on that note, you must head to your carrier store and request a new SIM card. Also, inform them about the “SIM not provisioned MM2” error, they will be able to execute proper diagnostics over your old SIM card and hopefully get it resolved. Or else, they’ll equip you with a brand new SIM card and swap the new SIM card into your device and get it activated in the meantime. Eventually, restoring the normal functioning of your device.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In wrapping up, SIM not provisioned errors on Android can be troubling, but they’re certainly fixable.

However, Samsung Galaxy F04 stands as an exception in such case. And therefore, many times <strong><em>TouchWiz starts stopping</em></strong> right after upgrading. Thus, due to the collection of cache data, TouchWiz can display error. This calls for removing the cache from TouchWiz and run things smoothly. Here is how to do this:</p><ul><li>Tap on “Apps” from the Home screen firstly.</li><li>Launch “Settings” afterwards</li><li>Look for “Applications” and tap on it followed by “Application Manager”.</li><li>When Application Manager gets opened, swipe towards right to get into the “All” screen.</li><li>Now, choose “TouchWiz” and tap “Clear Cache”.</li><li>Now, tap “Clear Data” followed by “OK”.</li><li>Now restart your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-cache-touchwiz.jpg"                      alt="clear cache to fix touchwiz home stopping"                ></p><p>Please note that this will delete all your Home screens post this method.</p><h3 id="Disable-Motion-gesture-settings"><a href="#Disable-Motion-gesture-settings" class="headerlink" title="Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings"></a>Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings</h3><p>The functions regarding Motions and Gestures can be responsible for why <strong><em>TouchWiz home has stopped</em></strong> in your device.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-F04-Not-Connecting-to-Wi-Fi-12-Quick-Ways-to-Fix"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-F04-Not-Connecting-to-Wi-Fi-12-Quick-Ways-to-Fix" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy F04 Not Connecting to Wi-Fi? 12 Quick Ways to Fix"></a>Samsung Galaxy F04 Not Connecting to Wi-Fi? 12 Quick Ways to Fix</h2><p>Nowadays, it’s pretty much essential to have your Samsung Galaxy F04 or smartphone connected to the internet. Whether you’re watching videos, looking something up, or using any kind of app, you need the internet for these applications to function correctly.</p><p>This is why it can so annoying when it gets to a point where the internet connection isn’t working. However, the problem of a web page not loading correctly is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>There are plenty of problems you could experience, whether it’s the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/why-does-my-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi.html" >Wi-Fi network keeps disconnecting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on its own without any warning, perhaps a security issue where the passcode or IP address isn’t being registered properly, or even if the connection is just being super slow, even if there’s no reason too.</p><p>Luckily, despite there being so many problems out there, there are also many solutions. Today, we’re going to share with you the complete definitive guide to help you get your Samsung Galaxy F04 connected and free from problems and issues.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Restart-your-Samsung-Galaxy-F04"><a href="#Part-1-Restart-your-Samsung-Galaxy-F04" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Restart your Samsung Galaxy F04"></a>Part 1: Restart your Samsung Galaxy F04</h2><p>Begin by powering off your Samsung Galaxy F04 and unplugging your router. Wait for about a minute before plugging in the router and turning on your device. This simple reset can often restore stable connections and fix Android wifi not working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android.jpg"                      alt="restart android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off"><a href="#Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off"></a>Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off</h2><p>Turn on Airplane Mode for a few seconds, then turn it off. This maneuver refreshes your device’s network connections and might rectify the Android not connecting to wifi issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android-1.jpg"                      alt="turn on airplane mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Wi-Fi-Router-settings"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Wi-Fi-Router-settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings"></a>Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings</h2><p>The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Samsung Galaxy F04. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.</p><p>However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem.

Fix It Now"></a>Samsung Galaxy F04 Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Samsung Galaxy F04.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Samsung Galaxy F04. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Samsung Galaxy F04 right where you are, without needing to take the Samsung Galaxy F04 device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Samsung Galaxy F04 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

When in Safe Mode, the Samsung Galaxy F04 device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won’t run. Here’s how you can boot your Samsung Galaxy F04 into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Power Off Your Device</strong></p><p>Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Safe Mode</strong></p><p>To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:</p><ul><li>For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer’s logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Samsung Galaxy F04 device finishes booting. You should see “Safe Mode” displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.</li><li>Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Samsung Galaxy F04 device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Samsung Galaxy F04.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.</p><p>A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home&#x2F;main screen of the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn’t respond to any command, even the power on command.</p><p>If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.</p><p>Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?"></a>Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?</h2><p>To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.</p><p>A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error&#x2F;crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg" alt="hard bricked v/s soft bricked"></p><p>Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone. The techniques listed here are the best and the most efficient ways to get your phone back to its normal working conditions without losing your important data or damaging your device or its software.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop"></a>Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop</h2><p>This is the first sign of a soft bricked Android phone. Boot Loop is nothing but when your phone does not remain switched off and turns itself on automatically, and freezes at the logo screen or blank screen, every time you manually try to power it off.</p><p>Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions. These partitions are nothing but storage locations for your modem, kernels, system files, drivers and built-in Apps data.</p><p>It is advisable to clear Cache partitions regularly to keep your phone free from such glitches.</p><p>Since the phone refuses to boot, Cache can be cleared from entering into the Recovery Mode. Different Android devices have different ways to put it in recovery mode. Normally pressing the power key and volume down key helps, but you may refer to your phone’s guide for better understanding and then follow the steps given below to clear the cache partition:</p><p>Once you are the recovery mode screen, you will see a number of options as shown in the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987490613783.jpg"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p>Use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987491246838.jpg"                      alt="”Wipe cache partition”"                >&gt;</p><p>After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged up and unwanted files. You may loose some App related data, but that is a small price to pay to fix your bricked phone.</p><p>If this method does not boot up your brick smartphone and the problem still persists, there are two more things you can try. Read ahead to find out about them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode"><a href="#Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode"></a>Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode</h2><p>If your bricked phone does not boot up to your Home Screen or Lock screen and instead boots directly into Recovery Mode, there is not much left to do. Booting straight into recovery mode is undoubtedly a soft brick error but it also indicates a possible problem with your current ROM. The only option you have to flash a new ROM to reboot your bricked phone back to its normal functioning.</p><p>To flash a new ROM:</p><p>Firstly, you must root your phone and unlock the Bootloader. Every phone’s mechanism to unlock the bootloader is different, thus, we suggest to refer to your user manual.</p><p>Once the Bootloader is unlocked, take a backup of all your data by selecting “Backup” or “Android” back in recovery mode. The process should not take long and all you need to do is tap “OK” to config backup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191436732.jpg"                      alt="backup and restore"                ></p><p>In this step, download a ROM of your choice and store it in your SD Card. Insert the SD Card in your phone to begin the flashing process.</p><p>Once at the recovery mode, select “Install Zip from SD Card” from the options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191676749.jpg"                      alt="install zip from sdcard"                ></p><p>Scroll down using the volume key and use the power key to select the downloaded ROM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191926694.jpg"                      alt="Scroll down"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987192218478.jpg"                      alt="select the downloaded ROM"                ></p><p>This might take a few minutes of your time, but once the process is complete, reboot your phone.</p><p>Hopefully, your bricked phone will not boot normally and work smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader"><a href="#Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader"></a>Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader</h2><p>If your bricked phone boots straight into Bootloader, then this a serious issue and must not be taken lightly.

Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Settings</strong>in the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg"                      alt="settings in spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap <strong>Log Out</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg"                      alt="log out of spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Log In</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-6.jpg"                      alt="log into spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter your login credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap <strong>Login</strong>again, and you’re in.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-7.jpg"                      alt="re-login to spotify with your credentials"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h3><p>Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.

That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>on your Android.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong>or <strong>General Management</strong> (depending on your Android model).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to <strong>Date and Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Set Date</strong>and set the correct date.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-9.jpg"                      alt="set date on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to <strong>Set Time</strong>and set the right time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg"                      alt="set time on android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Your-System-Software"><a href="#6-Update-Your-System-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Your System Software"></a>6. Update Your System Software</h3><p>Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated.

It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of Samsung Galaxy A54 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Samsung Galaxy A54 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Samsung Galaxy A54 5G screens to become unresponsive.

These issues can also occur in any Samsung Galaxy A54 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Samsung Galaxy A54 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector.

However, there are a few things you can do to take pictures of these apps and website content.</p><p>Enable Screen Capture on Android</p><p>Sudden “<strong>can’t take screenshot due to security policy</strong>” notifications, failing to take a screenshot, and a Samsung Galaxy A54 5G user?</p><p>If you are using this Android device, you can enable the screen capture feature in the Settings app.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong>, then tap the <strong>More options</strong> icon in the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-04.jpg"                      alt="android app settings interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose <strong>Special access</strong> &gt; <strong>All files access</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-05.jpg"                      alt="android apps special access settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enable <strong>Samsung Galaxy A54 5G capture</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-06.jpg"                      alt="enable samsung capture"                ></p><p>Once you have enabled screen capture, you can check if you can take screenshots of any app or website.</p><p>Enable Screenshots in Incognito Mode</p><p>Apps and websites may prohibit screenshots in incognito mode to protect your privacy. However, you can enable the Incognito Screenshot experimental flag in Chrome to bypass this restriction.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Chrome on your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G and type “chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;flags” in the address bar.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg"                      alt="chrome experimental flags"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for Incognito Screenshot and choose <strong>Enabled</strong> from the drop-down menu.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-08.jpg"                      alt="incognito screenshot enabled"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Relaunch</strong> on the lower right corner of the screen.</li></ul><p>Once Chrome has relaunched, you should be able to take screenshots in incognito mode by pressing the power and volume-down buttons at the same time.</p><p>Use Google Assistant</p><p>With Google Assistant, taking screenshots on your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G is now easier than ever. Just say, “Hey, Google, take a screenshot,” Google Assistant will capture the screen and save it to your gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-09.jpg"                      alt="google assistant command"                ></p><p>Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots</p><p>You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:</p><ul><li>Screenshot Easy</li><li>Screenshot Tile</li><li>Screen Master: Screenshot Markup</li></ul><p>Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.</p><p>Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device</p><p>If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.</p><p>Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions</p><p>Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.</p><p>Screen Mirroring</p><p>Smart View allows you to display your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down the top of the screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>Smart View</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap <strong>Start Now</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-10.jpg"                      alt="cast samsung phone using smart view"                ></p><p>Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.</p><p>Use Disable Flag Secure Magisk Module</p><p>Still experiencing the error message, “<strong>Can’t take screenshot due to security policy?” Bypass Android</strong> phone error like this using a module.</p><p>The module patches the Android framework to remove the FLAG_SECURE flag from apps. It is a relatively simple process but requires root access and Magisk. This module will turn off the security flag to take screenshots in Incognito mode and other apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-11.jpg"                      alt="magiskzip disable flag secure module"                ></p><p>Authors Verdict</p><p>There are a few ways to bypass screenshot restrictions on Android apps and websites, but some methods are more complicated than others. All methods should work, but if you think your device has been compromised, it is important to check if it is a system issue.</p><p>You can use a third-party tool like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> without rooting your device.

Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Samsung Galaxy A54 5G phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Samsung Galaxy A54 5Gs because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Samsung Galaxy A54 5G is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Samsung Galaxy A54 5G, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p>_Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can’t even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.</p><h2 id="Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone"><a href="#Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone"></a>Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone</h2><p>If the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue.

When in Safe Mode, the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won’t run. Here’s how you can boot your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Power Off Your Device</strong></p><p>Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Safe Mode</strong></p><p>To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:</p><ul><li>For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer’s logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device finishes booting. You should see “Safe Mode” displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.</li><li>Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode.

Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot.

It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out.

Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.

Here’s How to Fix It</h2><p>Samsung Galaxy M14 4G phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a <strong>Samsung Galaxy M14 4G touch screen not working</strong>, which can be frustrating and difficult.</p><p>This article aims to provide solutions for Samsung Galaxy M14 4G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>Samsung Galaxy M14 4G touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a Samsung Galaxy M14 4G phone’s screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of Samsung Galaxy M14 4G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Samsung Galaxy M14 4G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Samsung Galaxy M14 4G model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## The Common Solutions To Solve A Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Screen Unresponsive<p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Samsung Galaxy M14 4G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G model.</p><h3 id="1-Restart-The-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-The-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart The Device"></a>1. Restart The Device</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mui restart button"                ></p><p>Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G black screen problem. It’s a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone’s memory.</p><p>It is the most commonly used method to fix Samsung Galaxy M14 4G’s touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Samsung Galaxy M14 4Glogo appears.</p><h3 id="2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely"><a href="#2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely" class="headerlink" title="2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely"></a>2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg"                      alt="low battery"                ></p><p>Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-Custom-Service"><a href="#3-Contact-Custom-Service" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact Custom Service"></a>3. Contact Custom Service</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi contact customer service"                ></p><p>If restarting the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn’t resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device in for repair or replacement. It’s important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.</p><p>In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Y2 and Samsung Galaxy M14 4G 5A.</p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Device-Performance"><a href="#4-Optimize-Device-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Device Performance"></a>4. Optimize Device Performance</h3><p>One solution is to optimize the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.</p><p>You can clear your cached data using the default settings.</p><ul><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Cached Data</strong>.</li><li>To clear the cache, select <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png"                      alt="clear cached data on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Back Up And Factory Reset"></a>5. Back Up And Factory Reset</h3><p>Another solution is to back up the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone’s settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device, so it should only be considered a last resort.</p><p>In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.</p><ul><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the A<strong>dditional settings</strong> section of the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Redmi 5A settings.</li><li>Please scroll down the screen until you reach the <strong>Backup &amp; reset</strong> option, then click to access it.</li><li>Click<strong>Erase all data (factory reset)</strong> to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Redmi 5A.</li><li>Select <strong>All files on the phone</strong>to make a complete format of the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Redmi 5A.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/factory-reset-on-xiaomi5a-1.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair"><a href="#6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Using Dr. Fone Repair"></a>6. Using Dr. Fone Repair</h3><p>If none of the above solutions worked, you can try using Dr. Fone Repair.

Then follow the steps given below:</p><p>Step 1: Launch the application and choose the System Repair option from the main interface. Connect your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G to the computer and choose the Android Repair mode, and hit the Start button to begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="fix android not receiving texts with Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will have to provide information about your device, including the brand, name, model, country, and carrier. In between, you will be notified that your device repair might erase the existing data of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="android not receiving texts - provide info"                ></p><p>Step 3: Agree with the conditions and hit the Next button.

Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4Gs because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Samsung Galaxy M14 4G is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages.

Today, we’re going to share with you the complete definitive guide to help you get your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G connected and free from problems and issues.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Restart-your-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G"><a href="#Part-1-Restart-your-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Restart your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G"></a>Part 1: Restart your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G</h2><p>Begin by powering off your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G and unplugging your router. Wait for about a minute before plugging in the router and turning on your device. This simple reset can often restore stable connections and fix Android wifi not working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/wifi-not-working-on-android.jpg"                      alt="restart android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off"><a href="#Part-2-Turn-on-Airplane-mode-and-turn-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off"></a>Part 2: Turn on Airplane mode and turn off</h2><p>Turn on Airplane Mode for a few seconds, then turn it off.

Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.</p><p>However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.</p><ol><li>Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights</li><li>While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem</li><li>Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again</li><li>Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area</li><li>Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode"><a href="#Part-4-Boot-your-Android-in-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.</p><p>The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G, but the basic process goes as follows;</p><ol><li>Turn off your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device is completely off</li><li>Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time</li><li>You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device loads</li><li>Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works</li></ol><p>If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter"><a href="#Part-5-Check-the-Android-Wi-Fi-adapter" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

This could be an adapter on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.</p><p>You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.</p><ol><li>If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection</li><li>If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there</li><li>Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection</li></ol><h2 id="Part-6-Check-SSID-and-IP-address-on-Android"><a href="#Part-6-Check-SSID-and-IP-address-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android"></a>Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android</h2><p>To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.</p><p>Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G. Here’s how to check on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G to make sure everything is correct.</p><ol><li>Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G</li><li>Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router</li><li>Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router</li><li>Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches</li></ol><p>When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Fix-Android-system-issues-in-one-click"><a href="#Part-7-Fix-Android-system-issues-in-one-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 7.

To answer your question and explain to you why an App won’t open on your phone, here are some probable and simple reasons to make you understand the real problem.</p><p>It is appropriate to tag our generation as smartphone addicts because we use smartphones for anything and everything. All our important information, such as photos, videos, audio files, documents, notes, calendars, emails, etc, are stored on our phones. This causes a major storage&#x2F;space problem in our phones and <strong>a shortage of storage space</strong> is one of the main reasons why an App won’t open or why all Apps won’t open on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G. To see how much of your storage space is occupied by Apps, go to “Settings” and select “Application Manager”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984182929893.jpg"                      alt="Application Manager"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583143306.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Another possible reason for Apps to crash or why an App won’t open is a possible data crash. This may occur due to <strong>an unstable internet connection</strong> or <strong>various other background software interruptions</strong>.</p><p>The causes for the problem to occur are many and no specific reason can be established as the only reason why Apps won’t open on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G.

If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

An “Application not installed” error message usually pops up when you are trying to download and install an App with a .apk file extension from somewhere other than the Google Play Store. The error is very confusing at first but makes sense when you realize that this unknown Error Code during Application installation is neither a software issue nor a hardware problem. It is a direct outcome of what you do with your device. Yes, you heard that right. Your faulty actions can cause Android App not installed error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/app-not-installed-error-in-android.jpg"                      alt="app not install on android"                ></p><p>What to do when trying to install the Android APK it says “app not installed”? It is terrible that you can’t install App on your device. But in this article, you will know more about the causes behind this error and the best ways to fix it, read on, here is all you need to know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error"><a href="#Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error"></a>Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error</h2><p>You may ask: Why can’t I download apps on my Samsung Galaxy M14 4G? Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G or tablet?

And when there are the files or data that are corrupted in the cache, this might raise the “Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped” error. Therefore, you need to clear the WhatsApp data if the above method went futile. Here are the steps.</p><ul><li>Open “Settings” and go to “App Manager” or “Apps &amp; Notifications” or “Applications”.</li><li>Now, from the list of all applications, choose “WhatsApp”.</li><li>Click on “Storage” and tap “Clear Data”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/clear-whatsapp-data.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix cache conflict"                ></p><h2 id="Cause-3-WhatsApp-components-corruption"><a href="#Cause-3-WhatsApp-components-corruption" class="headerlink" title="Cause 3: WhatsApp components corruption"></a>Cause 3: WhatsApp components corruption</h2><p>A lot of times, the WhatsApp crashes due to the corrupted components of WhatsApp. In such case, all you need to do is uninstall and install the WhatsApp again. This is how you do it.</p><ul><li>Uninstall the app right away from your Homescreen or from the “Settings” &gt; “Applications” &gt; “All” &gt; “WhatsApp” &gt; “Uninstall” (for some phones).</li><li>Go to “Play Store” and search “WhatsApp” on the search bar.</li><li>Tap on it and start downloading followed by installing it.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/install-whatsapp.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix component corruption"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone"></a>Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone</h2><p>Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.</p><ul><li>Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage. Make sure it is enough i.e. at least 100 to 200MB.</li><li>Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.</li></ul><h2 id="Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked"><a href="#Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked" class="headerlink" title="Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked"></a>Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked</h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Android device and Gmail account go hand in hand. To run the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device smoothly, it is always asked to enter your Gmail address for further configurations. And when WhatsApp stops on your device, the reason might be your Gmail account. Most probably it is not valid now or maybe hacked. If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.</p><ul><li>Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.</li><li>Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/log-out-gmail.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix gmail account"                ></p><p>Now, you can login again and check if WhatsApp works or not.</p><h2 id="Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone"></a>Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone</h2><p>If still nothing works and your WhatsApp keeps stopping, most likely the reason is the incompatibility of your WhatsApp with your device. In such case, the thing that comes to your rescue is mod WhatsApp version like GBWhatsApp. It is a mod app which is similar to WhatsApp but in a more modified way. With this, a user gets more functionalities and customizable settings when compared to WhatsApp.</p><p>If you’re wondering how you can find this app and install, you should keep reading.</p><p><strong>To find GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Since you can look for this mod app on the Play Store, here are some of the other secure places from where you can download apk file for this GBWhatsApp. Note down these websites to get GBWhatsApp downloaded if WhatsApp has stopped.</p><ul><li>Latest Mod APKs</li><li>UptoDown</li><li>Android APKs Free</li><li>Soft Alien</li><li>OpenTechInfo</li></ul><p><strong>To Install GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Now that you have decided where to download the apk file, these are the following steps that you should follow to install it on your phone. Please have a look:</p><ul><li>Firstly, open “Settings” on your device and go to “Security”. Turn the “Unknown Sources” option.

We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>Samsung Galaxy F54 5G touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-Samsung-Galaxy-F54-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-Samsung-Galaxy-F54-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A Samsung Galaxy F54 5G Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A Samsung Galaxy F54 5G Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a Samsung Galaxy F54 5G phone’s screen may become unresponsive.

These are known as the SSID and the IP address.</p><p>Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G. Here’s how to check on your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G to make sure everything is correct.</p><ol><li>Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G</li><li>Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router</li><li>Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router</li><li>Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches</li></ol><p>When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-7-Fix-Android-system-issues-in-one-click"><a href="#Part-7-Fix-Android-system-issues-in-one-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 7.
