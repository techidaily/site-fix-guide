Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Honor 70 Lite 5G device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Honor 70 Lite 5G device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Honor 70 Lite 5G device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Honor 70 Lite 5G contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Honor 70 Lite 5G device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Honor 70 Lite 5G device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Honor-70-Lite-5G-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Honor-70-Lite-5G-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Honor 70 Lite 5G is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Honor 70 Lite 5G is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Honor 70 Lite 5G is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users.

Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Honor 70 Lite 5Gs.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Honor 70 Lite 5G is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone.

You can now release the button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/enable-safe-mode.jpg"                      alt="safe mode"                ></p><h3 id="Reset-Factory-settings"><a href="#Reset-Factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Factory settings"></a>Reset Factory settings</h3><p>If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.</p><p>Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:</p><ul><li>Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup &amp; Reset”.</li><li>Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.</li><li>Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/reset-factory-settings.jpg"                      alt="reset factory settings"                ></p><ul><li>Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.</li></ul><h3 id="Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz"><a href="#Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz" class="headerlink" title="Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz"></a>Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz</h3><p>We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your <strong><em>TouchWiz is not working</em></strong>, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-select-masterful-instagram-hlv-artisans/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Select  Masterful Instagram HLV Artisans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unleash-your-creative-edge-with-adjustable-story-videos/"><u>[New] Unleash Your Creative Edge with Adjustable Story Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-top-7-must-try-iphone-vr-experiences-you-cant-miss-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 7 Must-Try iPhone VR Experiences You Can’t Miss for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-conquering-low-light-with-iphones-advanced-hdr-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved  Conquering Low Light with iPhone’s Advanced HDR Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snicker-scribbles-humorhub/"><u>2024 Approved  Snicker Scribbles  HumorHub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/addressing-the-issue-of-erased-typing-on-windows-systems/"><u>Addressing the Issue of Erased Typing on Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/1722960668461-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-drivers-new-release-for-windows-11-8-and-7-download-free-today/"><u>GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Drivers: New Release for Windows 11, 8, and 7 – Download Free Today!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-free-up-iphone-xs-space-drfone-by-drfone-ios-full-data-eraser-ios-full-data-eraser/"><u>Guide on How To Free Up iPhone XS Space | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-of-itel-a70-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Phone Touchscreen Of Itel A70 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-of-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Phone Touchscreen Of Samsung Galaxy S23+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Samsung Galaxy F14 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-flash-dead-itel-s23plus-safely-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Flash Dead Itel S23+ Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-google-pixel-8-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Revive Your Bricked Google Pixel 8 in Minutes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-life360-from-tracking-you-on-vivo-y78t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Stop Life360 from Tracking You On Vivo Y78t? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-motorola-razr-40-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Stop My Spouse from Spying on My Motorola Razr 40 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-unbrick-a-dead-xiaomi-redmi-a2-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Unbrick a Dead Xiaomi Redmi A2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-vivo-y56-5g-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgot Pattern Lock?

Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.</li><li>**Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system’s built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.</li><li>**Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches.

When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.</li><li><strong>Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:</strong> Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware.
