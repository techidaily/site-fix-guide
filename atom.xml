How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Infinix Note 30 Pro device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Infinix Note 30 Pro device is fully turned off.

Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Infinix Note 30 Pro is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Infinix Note 30 Pro, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Infinix Note 30 Pro device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="7-Solutions-to-Fix-Chrome-Crashes-or-Won’t-Open-on-Infinix-Note-30-Pro"><a href="#7-Solutions-to-Fix-Chrome-Crashes-or-Won’t-Open-on-Infinix-Note-30-Pro" class="headerlink" title="7 Solutions to Fix Chrome Crashes or Won’t Open on Infinix Note 30 Pro"></a>7 Solutions to Fix Chrome Crashes or Won’t Open on Infinix Note 30 Pro</h2><p>Google Chrome is one of the most popular web browsers in the world.

If you keep open the tabs, it may slow down the performance of Chrome and the app will use RAM. As a result, it will obviously get stopped midway. Therefore, we suggest you to close the tabs which are opened. And once you do that, exit the app and then launch it again.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Too-much-memory-used"><a href="#Part-2-Too-much-memory-used" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Too much memory used"></a>Part 2: Too much memory used</h2><p>When Chrome or any other app keeps running on the background, issues like “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” are likely to occur.

Look for “Chrome” and tap on it.</p><p>3.

We doubt if the particular website you are making use of is the culprit and making Chrome keeps stopping. In such case, we would like to recommend you to make use of another browser and try to access the website from there. See if this works or not.

This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue.

Doing this will not fix the issue but will make the cracks less noticeable. On the other hand, you can also apply a screen protector to safeguard your phone against further damage. The screen protector slows down or prevents the cracks from getting worse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134241/18498" target="_top" id="2134241">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134241" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134241/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Can-I-Use-Dr-Fone-for-Free"><a href="#3-Can-I-Use-Dr-Fone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.

Here’s how you can do that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find <strong>Google Play Services</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap it and press <strong>Uninstall Updates</strong>at the bottom.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-3.jpeg"                      alt="uninstall google play services updates"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Exit the <strong>Settings</strong>app and restart the phone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Open the <strong>Play Store</strong>app and head into the app’s settings by clicking your profile icon. Then scroll to the bottom, and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Find and tap the <strong>Play Store version</strong>to update your <strong>Google Play Services</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>As you’re already there, you might as well update all other apps after you tap <strong>Manage apps &amp; device</strong>. That will ensure that older and not-up-to-date apps aren’t causing the issue.</p><h3 id="5-Check-Storage"><a href="#5-Check-Storage" class="headerlink" title="5. Check Storage"></a>5. Check Storage</h3><p>Believe it or not, one of the leading causes of the Google Play Services issue is a phone overfilled with apps. Namely, if you have insufficient storage, the Google Play Store app will likely crash and display errors such as “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working.”</p><p>Head into your phone’s Settings and select Storage to see how your phone’s doing storage-wise. Deleting a few apps you don’t use and transferring your photo and video library to a PC is highly advisable if your phone’s storage space lacks gigabytes.</p><h3 id="6-Do-a-System-Repair"><a href="#6-Do-a-System-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Do a System Repair"></a>6. Do a System Repair</h3><p>Although the other solutions here are general fixes that might help, a system repair might take a bit longer but will undoubtedly fix your issue. You can use the Wondershare Dr.Fone app to repair the system and eliminate the annoying “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working” error.</p><p>Moreover, Dr. Fone works on Android and iOS devices and can fix various phone issues, including boot loops, a white screen of death, a stuck phone, etc. That’s why we’ve included a guide on using it for an Android phone issue. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Launch the Wondershare Dr.Fone app on your PC and head into <strong>Toolkit</strong>&gt; <strong>System Repair</strong> &gt; <strong>Android</strong>.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="start the wondershare dr.fone app"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the type of issue you want to fix &gt; <strong>Start</strong>.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-1.png"                      alt="start the android system repair"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select the make and model of your phone so that Dr.Fone can find the appropriate Android software.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="choose the phone model"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Connect the phone to the PC via a USB cable and follow the on-screen instructions to put the phone into <strong>Download Mode</strong>. The instructions are available for both phones with and without the home button.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-4.png"                      alt="put the phone into download mode"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Select the appropriate Android firmware, download it, and hit <strong>Fix Now</strong>after it downloads.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-5.png"                      alt="download android firmware before repair"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Enter the code and hit <strong>Confirm</strong>to continue the system repair process. When it’s done, click the <strong>Done</strong></p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-7.png"                      alt="confirm android system repair"                ></p></li></ul><p>That’s all it takes to do a system repair with Wondershare Dr.Fone. Give the software a few minutes to complete, during which your phone might restart a few times. Once it’s done, your Google Play Services app will undoubtedly work.</p><h3 id="7-Clear-Cache"><a href="#7-Clear-Cache" class="headerlink" title="7. Clear Cache"></a>7. Clear Cache</h3><p>The easiest and the most obvious fix for many Android apps is clearing the app’s cache. Here’s how you can do that for Google Play Services and Google Play Store:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find the <strong>Google Play Store</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap <strong>Storage</strong>and hit the <strong>Clear cache</strong></p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-10.jpg"                      alt="clear app cache"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Repeat the process for the <strong>Google Play Services</strong></p></li></ul><p>If this doesn’t work, move on to another possible fix.</p><h3 id="8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings"><a href="#8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings" class="headerlink" title="8. Check Date and Time Settings"></a>8. Check Date and Time Settings</h3><p>Oddly enough, the Google Play Services app is prone to failure because of an incorrectly set time or date. That’s because Google’s servers constantly check these settings before issuing updates to the Nokia C110 devices, so you’ll need to ensure they’re correct beforehand. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Ensure that both “**<em>Use network–provided time</em><strong>” and “</strong><em>Use network-provided time zone</em>**” are toggled on.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-11.jpg"                      alt="check date and time settings"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If this doesn’t work, you can try repeating the process and manually setting the time and the time zone.</p></li></ul><p>Once you check or change these settings, try using the Google Play Store app and check whether the issue is fixed. Restarting the phone after changing the settings is also highly advisable.</p><h3 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection"></a>9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection</h3><p>Another regularly overlooked troublemaker is a poor internet connection. That’s because most apps nowadays are meant to work in online mode only, and losing connection or using a bad one interferes with the app’s functionality.</p><p>To test the internet connection on your Nokia C110, you should open a browser and head to a random internet page to see if it’s opening and whether there are any delays. If it’s working fine, your internet connection isn’t the problem.</p><h3 id="10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions"><a href="#10-Adjust-Google-Play-Services-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions"></a>10. Adjust Google Play Services Permissions</h3><p>Although permissions rarely change, they can cause issues if you change them accidentally. These settings can be found in the same place where you would uninstall updates or clear the app’s cache, so you can use some of the steps mentioned above to check them.</p><p>Once inside Permission Settings, check whether the Google Play Services and Play Store apps have sufficient permission to do their jobs and whether any required permissions were recently removed. If so, grant these two apps their permissions back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>4,953,228</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Although it’s an incredibly frustrating error, the “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped” message is more annoying than serious. We’ve explained why it happens, but we’ve also given you a list of solutions to fix it.</p><p>Our list includes various fixes, from simple ones, like deleting the app’s cache and ensuring your network works fine, to more serious ones, like doing a factory reset. Alternatively, you can do a system repair with the help of Wondershare Dr.Fone, which will certainly fix the problem, but it might be a bit more complicated than cache deletion.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-you-play-mp4-on-galaxy-a15-4g-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mp4-on-android/"><u>Can you play MP4 on Galaxy A15 4G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unfortunately-contacts-has-stopped-error-on-poco-c51-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Unfortunately, Contacts Has Stopped Error on Poco C51 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-downloading-samfw-frp-tool-30-for-nokia-130-music-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Downloading SamFw FRP Tool 3.0 for Nokia 130 Music</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/leading-websites-your-source-for-legal-skype-ringtones/"><u>Leading Websites Your Source for Legal Skype Ringtones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/mellifluous-multilingualism-the-science-of-music-in-learning/"><u>Mellifluous Multilingualism: The Science of Music in Learning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-not-working-on-oppo-a2-8-solutions-inside-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Not Working On Oppo A2? 8 Solutions Inside | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/strategies-for-apps-that-wont-download-from-play-store-on-motorola-edgeplus-2023-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Strategies for Apps That Wont Download From Play Store On Motorola Edge+ (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-extended-usage-activating-and-tweaking-your-iphones-idle-settings/"><u>Unlocking Extended Usage: Activating & Tweaking Your iPhone's Idle Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/unlocking-your-hp-laptops-full-screen-capture-capabilities/"><u>Unlocking Your HP Laptop's Full Screen Capture Capabilities</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Here’s How to Fix It</h2><p>Realme 11X 5G phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a <strong>Realme 11X 5G touch screen not working</strong>, which can be frustrating and difficult.</p><p>This article aims to provide solutions for Realme 11X 5G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>Realme 11X 5G touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-Realme-11X-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-Realme-11X-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A Realme 11X 5G Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A Realme 11X 5G Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a Realme 11X 5G phone’s screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of Realme 11X 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Realme 11X 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Realme 11X 5G device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Realme 11X 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Realme 11X 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Realme 11X 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><h2 id="The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Realme-11X-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Realme-11X-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="The Common Solutions To Solve A Realme 11X 5G Screen Unresponsive"></a>The Common Solutions To Solve A Realme 11X 5G Screen Unresponsive</h2><p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Realme 11X 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Realme 11X 5G model.</p><h3 id="1-Restart-The-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-The-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart The Device"></a>1. Restart The Device</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mui restart button"                ></p><p>Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Realme 11X 5G black screen problem. It’s a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone’s memory.</p><p>It is the most commonly used method to fix Realme 11X 5G’s touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Realme 11X 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem.

Leaving the Realme 11X 5G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Realme 11X 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-Custom-Service"><a href="#3-Contact-Custom-Service" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact Custom Service"></a>3. Contact Custom Service</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi contact customer service"                ></p><p>If restarting the Realme 11X 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn’t resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Realme 11X 5G device in for repair or replacement. It’s important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.</p><p>In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Realme 11X 5G Y2 and Realme 11X 5G 5A.</p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Device-Performance"><a href="#4-Optimize-Device-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Device Performance"></a>4. Optimize Device Performance</h3><p>One solution is to optimize the Realme 11X 5G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features.

The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Realme 11X 5G device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Realme 11X 5G device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Realme 11X 5G device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Realme 11X 5G contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Realme 11X 5G device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115936/19272" target="_top" id="2115936">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115936" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115936/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage.

On your Oppo A18, visit “Settings” and find “Storage”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14989068987919.jpg"                      alt="android settings"                ></p><p>2.

Or possibly, it may freeze after getting opened thereby hampering the Oppo A18 device’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/fix-unfortunately-settings-has-stopped.jpg"                      alt="unfortunately settings has stopped"                ></p><p>Well!

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Oppo A18 and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”.

RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Oppo A18 device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings. Also, if the apps in the background keep running, they might conflict with the Settings and stop it to perform properly. Therefore clearing RAM is important when Android Settings is not responding. Here is how to do it.</p><ol><li>Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen.

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Honor 100 Pro and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”.

RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Honor 100 Pro device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings.

For this, long-press the Home key.<br> Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen.

They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Oppo Find N3 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Oppo Find N3 device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Oppo Find N3 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Oppo Find N3 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Oppo Find N3 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Oppo Find N3 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Oppo-Find-N3-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Oppo-Find-N3-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Oppo Find N3 is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Oppo Find N3 is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Oppo Find N3 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Oppo Find N3s.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Oppo Find N3 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Oppo Find N3 device. So if your Oppo Find N3 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Oppo Find N3 device’s animation type and speed on your Oppo Find N3 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Oppo Find N3 to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Oppo Find N3 is running slow and freezing, the Oppo Find N3 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues"></a>Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues</h3><p>Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Oppo Find N3 device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Oppo Find N3 is running slow and freezing.</p><h3 id="Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable"><a href="#Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable" class="headerlink" title="Your Internet Connection is Unstable"></a>Your Internet Connection is Unstable</h3><p>Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Oppo Find N3 is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-My-Oppo-Find-N3-Lags"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-My-Oppo-Find-N3-Lags" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When My Oppo Find N3 Lags?"></a>What to Do When My Oppo Find N3 Lags?</h2><p>It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Lava Blaze Pro 5G is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Lava Blaze Pro 5G, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-take-fullscreen-digital-canvas/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Take Fullscreen Digital Canvas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-impact-making-an-engaging-podcast-trailer/"><u>[New] Maximizing Impact Making an Engaging Podcast Trailer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-androids-best-practice-for-saving-gameplay-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Android's Best Practice for Saving Gameplay Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-crafting-a-revenue-driven-approach-to-youtube-content-creation/"><u>[Updated] Crafting a Revenue-Driven Approach to YouTube Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perpetual-screen-moments-tool/"><u>2024 Approved Perpetual Screen Moments Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/bring-a-smile-simple-meme-creation-with-kapwing/"><u>Bring a Smile Simple Meme Creation With Kapwing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-honor-magic-6-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Honor Magic 6 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-hidefake-snapchat-location-on-your-tecno-phantom-v-flip-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Tecno Phantom V Flip | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-pause-life360-location-sharing-for-vivo-s18-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Pause Life360 Location Sharing For Vivo S18 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-unbrick-a-dead-lava-blaze-curve-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Unbrick a Dead Lava Blaze Curve 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-techniques-and-tips-for-high-quality-screen-recording-in-adobe-captivity/"><u>In 2024, Innovative Techniques & Tips for High-Quality Screen Recording in Adobe Captivity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/strategies-for-apps-that-wont-download-from-play-store-on-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Strategies for Apps That Wont Download From Play Store On Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Vivo X90S device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Vivo X90S device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Vivo X90S or tablet?

In between, you will be notified that your device repair might erase the existing data of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="android not receiving texts - provide info"                ></p><p>Step 3: Agree with the conditions and hit the Next button.

Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Vivo X90S is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Vivo X90S phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Vivo X90Ss because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Vivo X90S is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Vivo X90S is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Vivo X90S device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Vivo X90S, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p>_Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can’t even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.</p><h2 id="Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone"><a href="#Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone"></a>Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone</h2><p>If the Vivo X90S phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue. Usually, there is an option on the iPhone where they can send texts as iMessage and simple messages. If the iPhone user sends the text as iMessage, then it will not show up on the Android device. To resolve this, you have to follow the steps below:</p><p>Taking the iPhone in hand makes sure that you are connected to a network. Open settings and scroll to look for the Message option. Toggle the bar next to the iMessage option to turn it off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/deactivate-imessages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check iphone message"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If the FaceTime option is also on, you might have to deactivate that too to send messages and calls as regular ones.</p><h2 id="Part-11-Update-Your-Android"><a href="#Part-11-Update-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 11: Update Your Android"></a>Part 11: Update Your Android</h2><p>Updating the operating system to the latest Android version can fix some system errors which may cause the “Android not receiving texts” issue because the latest version always brings a better user experience and fix the know bugs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115949/19272" target="_top" id="2115949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Now you know several methods that can work if the Android messaging app is not working.  If you experience this kind of issue with your Vivo X90S, then you are most likely to resolve them with these fixes.

That’s why facing the “<strong>Play Store app not available in your country</strong>“ issue can be frustrating. The positive aspect is that many solutions exist for addressing this issue. Presented below are the top 4 approaches to resolving this matter:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Change-Your-Google-Play-Store-Country"><a href="#Method-1-Change-Your-Google-Play-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Change Your Google Play Store Country"></a>Method 1: Change Your Google Play Store Country</h3><p>One of the most direct ways to address this issue is by manually adjusting your Google Play Store country settings. Google allows users to change their country or region. Remember that you can only do it once a year. To utilize this approach, it’s essential to reside in the specified country. The other option is to provide a payment method originating from that particular region. Below is a detailed walkthrough for this procedure:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Launch the Google Play Store on your Vivo S18 and tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner. Here, choose “Settings” and follow on to tap “General.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-1.jpg"                      alt="general settings play store"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Within the “General” tab, move towards “Account and device preferences” and tap it. There, select “Country and profiles” and tap the country to change it. Now, follow the on-screen prompts to complete the procedure.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-2.jpg"                      alt="update residence country"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-a-Reliable-VPN"><a href="#Method-2-Use-a-Reliable-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use a Reliable VPN"></a>Method 2: Use a Reliable VPN</h3><p>Confronting the message “<strong>This app is not accessible in your country” on the Play Store</strong>? Employing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be an effective strategy. It allows you to virtually transcend geographical restrictions. A VPN masks your actual location by routing your internet connection through servers in different regions.</p><p>You can utilize a reliable VPN to access the Play Store as though you were in a region where the desired app is accessible. Follow this step-by-step guide to address this concern:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access the Google Play Store and download a reliable VPN for the procedure. Open the VPN you download and connect to the country of your choice. Once you have connected your device’s IP to another country using the VPN, continue to your home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-3.jpg"                      alt="get vpn from play store"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Look for Google Play Store on the home screen and long-press to open a menu. From the pop-up menu, choose “App Info,” and on the following screen, tap “Clear data.” Now, press “Clear cache” to wipe the cache.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-4.jpg"                      alt="clear play store cache"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go back to the “App info” screen and press “Force Stop” to force close the app. Afterward, relaunch the Play Store and access your targeted apps.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-5.jpg"                      alt="try force stopping app"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Download-an-APK-File"><a href="#Method-3-Download-an-APK-File" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Download an APK File"></a>Method 3: Download an APK File</h3><p>One way to resolve the issue at hand is to sideload the app by downloading its APK file. It can be a viable and direct solution where other methods fail. This method involves installing the application manually, bypassing the Google Play Store. Follow these sequential instructions to download and install an APK file:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Before starting, ensure that you have enabled the installation from unknown sources. Afterward, find a reliable website and search for your targeted apps.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-6.jpg"                      alt="download apk from website"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you have found the targeted app, download it on your Vivo S18.

Updating your Tecno Spark 10 5G’s software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.</p><p>To update the software on your Tecno Spark 10 5G, follow these steps:</p><p>Go to “Settings” on your Tecno Spark 10 5G and navigate to the “System” or “Software Update” section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to “Check for updates” to see if any new software updates are available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off.jpg"                      alt="update software"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off"><a href="#Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off"></a>Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off</h2><p>When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Tecno Spark 10 5G device’s internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone’s internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.</p><p>To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off-1.jpg"                      alt="cool down the phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode"></a>Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode</h2><p>Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function. If you can use your phone in Safe Mode, consider deleting the unnecessary Apps which may be burdening the phone’s processor.</p><p>To boot into Safe Mode:</p><p>Long press the power button to see the following options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529157169.jpeg"                      alt="device options"                ></p><p>Now tap on “Power Off” for about 10 seconds and click “OK” on the message that pops-up as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529389258.jpg"                      alt="safe mode"                ></p><p>Once done, the phone will reboot and you will see “Safe Mode” on the main screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529591962.jpg"                      alt="safe mode"                ></p><p>That’s all.

They generate problems or steal resources from each other, such as RAM, causing crashes and errors.</p><p>There’s also the issue of wrong app versions. Although each Android phone uses the Android operating system, these systems can be vastly different, and the apps built for them can be made to be phone-specific and only run on a specific phone model.</p><p>That’s also the case with Google Play Store and Google Play Services.</p><h2 id="Why-Google-Play-Services-Keeps-Stopping"><a href="#Why-Google-Play-Services-Keeps-Stopping" class="headerlink" title="Why Google Play Services Keeps Stopping"></a>Why Google Play Services Keeps Stopping</h2><p>The Google Play Services keeps stopping error is an infamous one, and it can appear for various reasons and even on brand new phones.

Try them out and see whether they fix the issue.</p><h3 id="1-Do-a-Factory-Reset"><a href="#1-Do-a-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Factory Reset"></a>1. Do a Factory Reset</h3><p>A factory reset on any smartphone removes all your data on the phone’s internal storage and can even wipe your SD card clean if you select the option. Before you reset your phone to factory settings, ensure you’ve backed up all your essential apps and files. When you’re ready, you can do a factory reset by following these steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>and search for “<em>reset</em>.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose <strong>Factory reset</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap the <strong>Erase all data</strong>or <strong>Reset device</strong> at the bottom, whichever button is there.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-2.jpeg"                      alt="android factory reset"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Input your password and confirm the action.</p></li></ul><p>Your phone will now restart and start the reset process. Once the factory reset completes, your phone will look brand new, and you’ll need to install all your apps again. Moreover, your Google Play Services app will likely get fixed by this, too.</p><h3 id="2-Update-Your-System"><a href="#2-Update-Your-System" class="headerlink" title="2. Update Your System"></a>2. Update Your System</h3><p>As keeping your phone’s system and apps updated to the latest possible version is essential and recommended for the best performance and highest efficiency, you can try updating it to see whether it fixes your Google Play Services error. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong></li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Head into <strong>System</strong>&gt; <strong>System update</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: If there’s an update available, click it and go through the process of updating your phone’s system.</li></ul><p>Restarting your phone after an update, even if it doesn’t restart itself, is highly advisable, ensuring that the new updates apply without issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115932/19272" target="_top" id="2115932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Revert-to-the-Previous-Version"><a href="#3-Revert-to-the-Previous-Version" class="headerlink" title="3. Revert to the Previous Version"></a>3. Revert to the Previous Version</h3><p>As we’ve discussed the wrong Play Services versions above, it’s worth noting that sometimes even the developers can make mistakes and roll out the wrong version for your phone. So, if you notice that the phone is getting the error after you’ve updated Google Services or the Play Store, you can quickly revert to the previous version, and here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Google Play Services.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Press the <strong>Disable</strong>button at the bottom of the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Restart the phone, repeat the process by clicking <strong>Enable</strong>this time, and restart the phone again.</li></ul><p>As these are system apps, you can’t remove them from the phone, and disabling them will only remove the updates, leaving you with a base version that came with your phone out of the box.</p><h3 id="4-Uninstall-the-App’s-Updates-and-Reinstall"><a href="#4-Uninstall-the-App’s-Updates-and-Reinstall" class="headerlink" title="4. Uninstall the App’s Updates and Reinstall"></a>4. Uninstall the App’s Updates and Reinstall</h3><p>Like reverting to the previous version, you can also try reinstalling updates to fix the Google Play Services has stopped working error. The process is similar to the one above, but we’ve still included the steps. Here’s how you can do that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find <strong>Google Play Services</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap it and press <strong>Uninstall Updates</strong>at the bottom.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-3.jpeg"                      alt="uninstall google play services updates"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Exit the <strong>Settings</strong>app and restart the phone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Open the <strong>Play Store</strong>app and head into the app’s settings by clicking your profile icon. Then scroll to the bottom, and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Find and tap the <strong>Play Store version</strong>to update your <strong>Google Play Services</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>As you’re already there, you might as well update all other apps after you tap <strong>Manage apps &amp; device</strong>. That will ensure that older and not-up-to-date apps aren’t causing the issue.</p><h3 id="5-Check-Storage"><a href="#5-Check-Storage" class="headerlink" title="5. Check Storage"></a>5. Check Storage</h3><p>Believe it or not, one of the leading causes of the Google Play Services issue is a phone overfilled with apps. Namely, if you have insufficient storage, the Google Play Store app will likely crash and display errors such as “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working.”</p><p>Head into your phone’s Settings and select Storage to see how your phone’s doing storage-wise. Deleting a few apps you don’t use and transferring your photo and video library to a PC is highly advisable if your phone’s storage space lacks gigabytes.</p><h3 id="6-Do-a-System-Repair"><a href="#6-Do-a-System-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Do a System Repair"></a>6. Do a System Repair</h3><p>Although the other solutions here are general fixes that might help, a system repair might take a bit longer but will undoubtedly fix your issue. You can use the Wondershare Dr.Fone app to repair the system and eliminate the annoying “Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working” error.</p><p>Moreover, Dr. Fone works on Android and iOS devices and can fix various phone issues, including boot loops, a white screen of death, a stuck phone, etc. That’s why we’ve included a guide on using it for an Android phone issue.

Here’s how you can do that for Google Play Services and Google Play Store:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Apps</strong> and find the <strong>Google Play Store</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap <strong>Storage</strong>and hit the <strong>Clear cache</strong></p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-10.jpg"                      alt="clear app cache"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Repeat the process for the <strong>Google Play Services</strong></p></li></ul><p>If this doesn’t work, move on to another possible fix.</p><h3 id="8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings"><a href="#8-Check-Date-and-Time-Settings" class="headerlink" title="8. Check Date and Time Settings"></a>8. Check Date and Time Settings</h3><p>Oddly enough, the Google Play Services app is prone to failure because of an incorrectly set time or date. That’s because Google’s servers constantly check these settings before issuing updates to the Honor 90 Lite devices, so you’ll need to ensure they’re correct beforehand. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Head into <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Ensure that both “**<em>Use network–provided time</em><strong>” and “</strong><em>Use network-provided time zone</em>**” are toggled on.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/fix-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-11.jpg"                      alt="check date and time settings"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If this doesn’t work, you can try repeating the process and manually setting the time and the time zone.</p></li></ul><p>Once you check or change these settings, try using the Google Play Store app and check whether the issue is fixed. Restarting the phone after changing the settings is also highly advisable.</p><h3 id="9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#9-Troubleshoot-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection"></a>9. Troubleshoot Your Internet Connection</h3><p>Another regularly overlooked troublemaker is a poor internet connection.

These settings can be found in the same place where you would uninstall updates or clear the app’s cache, so you can use some of the steps mentioned above to check them.</p><p>Once inside Permission Settings, check whether the Google Play Services and Play Store apps have sufficient permission to do their jobs and whether any required permissions were recently removed.
