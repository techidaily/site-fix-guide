However, Xiaomi 13 Ultra stands as an exception in such case. And therefore, many times <strong><em>TouchWiz starts stopping</em></strong> right after upgrading. Thus, due to the collection of cache data, TouchWiz can display error. This calls for removing the cache from TouchWiz and run things smoothly. Here is how to do this:</p><ul><li>Tap on “Apps” from the Home screen firstly.</li><li>Launch “Settings” afterwards</li><li>Look for “Applications” and tap on it followed by “Application Manager”.</li><li>When Application Manager gets opened, swipe towards right to get into the “All” screen.</li><li>Now, choose “TouchWiz” and tap “Clear Cache”.</li><li>Now, tap “Clear Data” followed by “OK”.</li><li>Now restart your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-cache-touchwiz.jpg"                      alt="clear cache to fix touchwiz home stopping"                ></p><p>Please note that this will delete all your Home screens post this method.</p><h3 id="Disable-Motion-gesture-settings"><a href="#Disable-Motion-gesture-settings" class="headerlink" title="Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings"></a>Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings</h3><p>The functions regarding Motions and Gestures can be responsible for why <strong><em>TouchWiz home has stopped</em></strong> in your device. Usually the Xiaomi 13 Ultra devices running on Android version less than Marshmallow are prone to encountering this issue. Or the Xiaomi 13 Ultra devices having modest specs often fall prey to the issue. When you disable these settings, you might get out of the problem.</p><h3 id="Change-the-Animation-Scale"><a href="#Change-the-Animation-Scale" class="headerlink" title="Change the Animation Scale"></a>Change the Animation Scale</h3><p>When you use TouchWiz, it may consume higher memory usage for high amount of graphic maintenance.

Here’s how:</p><h3 id="Clear-Cache-Partition"><a href="#Clear-Cache-Partition" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cache Partition"></a>Clear Cache Partition</h3><p>In case the above steps didn’t figure out the problem, here is the next tip.

As we already said, third-party apps can cause this issue, booting your device in the Safe mode will disable those apps temporarily. Hence you need to boot your Xiaomi 13 Ultra device to Safe mode and check if the reason is any third-party app.</p><ul><li>Switch off your device to initiate.</li><li>Press “Power” button and keep doing this until device’s logo appears on the screen.</li><li>When you see logo appearing, instantly release the button and start holding “Volume Down” button.</li><li>Keep holding until rebooting finishes.</li><li>You will now witness “Safe mode” on the bottom screen.

There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Xiaomi 13 Ultra right where you are, without needing to take the Xiaomi 13 Ultra device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Xiaomi 13 Ultra device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone.

It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Vivo X90S has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version.

This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone.

Updating your Vivo X90S’s software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.</p><p>To update the software on your Vivo X90S, follow these steps:</p><p>Go to “Settings” on your Vivo X90S and navigate to the “System” or “Software Update” section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to “Check for updates” to see if any new software updates are available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off.jpg"                      alt="update software"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off"><a href="#Part-5-Cool-down-your-phone-to-avoid-your-phone-keeps-turning-off" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off"></a>Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off</h2><p>When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Vivo X90S device’s internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone’s internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.</p><p>To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off-1.jpg"                      alt="cool down the phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Part-6-Narrow-down-the-randomly-turning-off-issue-in-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode"></a>Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode</h2><p>Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function.

Whenever you cannot access the content of your choice or when you want to play some games, they must have asked you to change your location or spoof it. Creating a fake location iOS will not just help you with games and content, but also hide your identity and keep stalkers away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-change-iphone-pic1.jpg"                      alt="location change in iphone"                ></p><p>The changed location will reflect in all of your social media databases and other everyday apps. No one can track you down using the over-smart softwares that pry on user locations on different apps they use. By doing so, you are enhancing your online security, protecting your privacy, and, in some cases, also keeping your personal information a secret. Trust us when we say that certain apps need your information worth plenty of bucks but get away with procuring it without your permission.</p><p>There is no harm in changing your GPS location, especially when the world wide web is eager to monetize your information. A proper iOS Fake GPS will keep you safe virtually. Then you might wonder, - How do I use apps to navigate the roads or track down that pub in the locality? Well, you can always revert to your original location whenever you want to just that these tricks will help you stay in the safe bubble most of the time.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-iPhone-Location-Settings-for"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-iPhone-Location-Settings-for" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is iPhone Location Settings for?"></a>Part 1: What is iPhone Location Settings for?</h2><p>The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn’t. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.</p><p>The in-built apps like ‘Camera’ use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg"                      alt="photo with date stamp"                ></p><p>Your ‘Reminder or Alarm’ apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you’ve reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg"                      alt="reminder app"                ></p><p>The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location apps"                ></p><p>Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in.

Pressing the “Home” button will dismiss the blank screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3: It’s time to spoof your location</strong></p><p>Go to Google Maps or iOS maps which will now show your current location.</p><p>Go to XCode and then choose “Simulate Location” from the “Debug” menu and then select a different location to test.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-13.jpg"                      alt="simulate your new location"                ></p><p>If you have done all that you need to do, then the location of your iOS device should instantly jump to the location that you have chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/fake-snapchat-location-14.jpg"                      alt="New location on iOS maps and Google Maps"                ></p><p>Now you can proceed and see if you have access to Geo-filters in the new location.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Spy Geo-Filters on Snapchat</strong></p><p>Now you can launch Snapchat and then access the filters in the area that you have teleported to. Remember that you can move from one location to the next on XCode without having to close Snapchat. Just cancel the current snap after changing the location and create a new snap to see the filters in the new location. If this fails to respond, then go back to Google maps or iOS map app and then ensure that you are in the desired location. Once you have done so, close Snapchat and restart it again, and you will be in the new location once more.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-paid-but-easy-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-3-A-paid-but-easy-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: A paid but easy way to fake Snapchat location without jailbreak"></a>Part 3: A paid but easy way to fake Snapchat location without jailbreak</h2><p>You can also fake your Snapchat GPS location using a premium app such as iTools. This is a popular application, used to spoof many other apps that require geo-location data to work. Another point to note is that the latest iPhone models cannot be jailbroken. The iOS version today is very secure and you cannot tweak it like before.</p><p>Thankfully, you can use a premium, not free, iTools to change your virtual location without jailbreaking the Honor Magic 5 Lite device. You can get iTools on a trial basis, but after the period expires, you will have to pay $30.95 to continue using it.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install iTools on your computer and then launch it. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the original USB cable that came with the Honor Magic 5 Lite device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the iTools panel and click on “toolbox”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-1.jpg"                      alt="Select Toolbox in iTools"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the Virtual Location button within the Toolbox Panel</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-2.jpg"                      alt="select Virtual Location in Toolbox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Type in the location that you want to teleport to and then click on ‘Move Here”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-3.jpg"                      alt="Select your desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now open your Snapchat and you will be able to access the filters found in the location that you typed in.</p><p>Once you are finished with this spoofed location, you can simply select “Stop Simulation” in iTools. This is a premium tool, but very simple to use. It is the best tool to use, especially if you are having a device with the latest iOS version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-4.jpg"                      alt="stop simulation after you have finished with the new location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-A-brief-comparison-of-XCode-vs-iTools-to-fake-Snapchat-GPS-location"><a href="#Part-4-A-brief-comparison-of-XCode-vs-iTools-to-fake-Snapchat-GPS-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: A brief comparison of XCode vs. iTools to fake Snapchat GPS location"></a>Part 4: A brief comparison of XCode vs. iTools to fake Snapchat GPS location</h2><p>From the steps used in both methods, it is very clear that iTools is the best app to use to fake your Snapchat GPS location for several reasons. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use -</strong> Using XCode to fake your Snapchat GPS location is a long and complicated process, whereas using iTools is simple and clean.</li><li><strong>Price –</strong> Although XCode is free while iTools is not, the benefits of using iTools surpass the cost. This makes it less-costly when it comes to performance and convenience.</li><li><strong>Security –</strong> XCode may not be very secure, especially when it comes to avoiding detection by Snapchat. You may have to keep going back to XCode, and changing the location, switching off Snapchat, and restating it again. However, when using iTools, your location is fixed until you stop the simulation.</li><li><strong>Versatility –</strong> XCode cannot be used on the latest iOS devices without posing problems, while iTools is a simple and effective tool for all iOS versions.</li></ul><h2 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion"></a>In conclusion</h2><p>When you want to spoof Snapchat to access Geo-Filters in any part of the world, you can use the complicated XCode or pay a fee and use the simpler iTools.

One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else’s mobile phone or device.</p><p>Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees’ devices or kids’ phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are <strong>mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker</strong>, etc.</p><p>The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don’t worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.</p><h3 id="How-to-Detect-mSpy-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Detect-mSpy-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices"></a>How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices</h3><p>For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that’ll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings.

Recently, the malware was found in an app called <strong>System Update</strong>. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users’ devices to the operators’ servers. It’s important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Honor Magic 5 Lite.</p><h4 id="2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage"><a href="#2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage" class="headerlink" title="2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reasons-for-Realme-12-5G-Stuck-on-Startup-Screen-and-Ways-To-Fix-Them"><a href="#Reasons-for-Realme-12-5G-Stuck-on-Startup-Screen-and-Ways-To-Fix-Them" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Realme 12 5G Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them"></a>Reasons for Realme 12 5G Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them</h2><p>There are many reasons why <strong><strong>phones get stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Realme 12 5G. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode.

Ensuring that SIM is not wet either and then putting it back into its place. If this works, then the SIM not working in Android was due to the dirt or moisture that was preventing proper contact between SIM card pins and smartphone circuit.</p><h3 id="2-3-Insert-the-SIM-card-correctly"><a href="#2-3-Insert-the-SIM-card-correctly" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly"></a>2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly</h3><p>If your SIM card was working properly until yet, there is a good possibility that the SIM card may have moved a bit from its actual location.

But if that’s not happening in your case and you’re wondering how to activate SIM card, make use of the three options below to enable activation:</p><ul><li>Call your carrier service provider</li><li>Send an SMS</li><li>Log on to your carrier’s website and look for the activation page over it.</li></ul><p>Note: The aforementioned options are straightforward and are quick ways to enable activation. It depends on your carrier network whether they support them.</p><h3 id="2-5-Contact-your-carrier"><a href="#2-5-Contact-your-carrier" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Contact your carrier"></a>2.5 Contact your carrier</h3><p>Even if your SIM isn’t activated, grab another working device to make a phone call to your carrier or network.

Thanks to the dual SIM technology, you do not have to rush immediately to get it to check or repair. You can simply rule out this possibility by ejecting the SIM card from its original SIM slot and then replacing it into the other SIM card slot. If this solution did work out for you then it is obvious that the problem was with the SIM card slot that got corrupted. And hence, it was triggering SIM not responding issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/insert-sim-properly.jpg"                      alt="fix SIM not responding - try another slot"                ></p><h3 id="2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones"><a href="#2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones" class="headerlink" title="2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones"></a>2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones</h3><p>Or just in case, you’ve still no joy and the SIM not provisioned on Android message is bothering you. Try making use of another Android device. Eject the SIM card from the Realme 12 5G device which is creating problems and try plugging it into other Realme 12 5G] and other smartphones. Perhaps, this will let you know whether the issue is with your device only or with the SIM card itself.</p><h3 id="2-8-Try-a-new-SIM-card"><a href="#2-8-Try-a-new-SIM-card" class="headerlink" title="2.8 Try a new SIM card"></a>2.8 Try a new SIM card</h3><p>Still, wondering how to fix SIM not provisioned?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Location-on-TikTok-to-See-More-Content-On-your-Tecno-Spark-20-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Change-Location-on-TikTok-to-See-More-Content-On-your-Tecno-Spark-20-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+"></a>How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+</h2><p>TikTok is a famous entertainment application that shows exciting content worldwide. It is now a popular application with a recorded 3 billion downloads while surpassing the popularity of Facebook and Twitter in 2018. But, sadly, the application keeps on being the victim of restrictions and bans in different countries worldwide.</p><p>This limits content broadcast in different regions, making TikTok lovers deprived of entertainment. But, if you know <strong>how to change location on TikTok</strong>, you can surpass all these restrictions easily. The article will help you learn <strong>how to change your TikTok location</strong> by presenting the following aspects:</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-TikTok-Detect-your-Location"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-TikTok-Detect-your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location"></a>Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location</h2><p>According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.</p><p>The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as “Technical Information.” In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.</p><p>Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.</p><p>If you don’t want to add your location on TikTok, you will have to deny the permissions on your phone. Hence, knowing how to change location on TikTok is necessary.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-We-Need-to-Change-Location-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-Why-We-Need-to-Change-Location-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok"></a>Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok</h2><p>We have discussed how TikTok gets to know about your location in the first part. Now, we will share why do we need to <strong>change location on TikTok:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>To Add Diversity to the Audience</strong></li></ul><p>The algorithm of TikTok is built so that it will only show the content of your region or country. Therefore, if you want to make money through your content on TikTok, it might not be possible for you. So, you may want to target the audience of another region that is willing to buy the content.</p><ul><li><strong>Access Better Content</strong></li></ul><p>Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should <strong>change your location on TikTok</strong> to access unlimited content.</p><ul><li><strong>Use the App without Hurdles</strong></li></ul><p>Countries like Afghanistan and India have banned the TikTok application, and Indonesia and Bangladesh have censored it. Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats.

You can’t just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ apps into believing that you are actually at that location.</p><p>Users don’t even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:</p><p>Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.</p><p>Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the “Move Here” option on the screen, and your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ location will instantly move to that particular location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/move-location-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Move Here option"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option. The app will show the new fake location, and you can share it with anyone you want.</p><p>To get your real location back, you will have to reboot your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+.

In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-OnePlus-Ace-2"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-OnePlus-Ace-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your OnePlus Ace 2"></a>2. Restart Your OnePlus Ace 2</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer.

Find your video player app, tap it, and scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the version installed on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-14.jpg"                      alt="android app version"                ></p><h3 id="9-Clear-Cookies-and-Browsing-Data"><a href="#9-Clear-Cookies-and-Browsing-Data" class="headerlink" title="9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data"></a>9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data</h3><p>If online videos are causing problems, not your recorded or downloaded ones, you might be due for a quick cookie and browsing data clearing.</p><p>Cookies are usually there to improve the user experience, allowing you to load websites faster and enjoy improved performance. However, if your cookies and browsing data occupy too much space, they could pose problems.</p><p>You’ll first need to launch your mobile browser to clear cookies and browsing data. If you’re using Google Chrome, the process is simple and streamlined. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner and go to <strong>Settings</strong>. From there, go to <strong>Privacy and security &gt; Clear browsing data &gt; Clear data</strong>.</p><h3 id="10-Reinstall-Video-Apps"><a href="#10-Reinstall-Video-Apps" class="headerlink" title="10. Reinstall Video Apps"></a>10. Reinstall Video Apps</h3><p>If you still have issues with videos not playing on your OnePlus Ace 2, you could try deleting and reinstalling your video apps. Sometimes, simply updating the video app might still retain the glitch causing problems. However, if you delete it in its entirety and then install it again, the issue should be gone.</p><p>To uninstall the video app on your Android, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong>. Locate the app you want to delete, then tap <strong>Uninstall</strong> at the bottom of your screen.</p><p>To reinstall it again, go to the Google Play Store, search for the video app you want to have, then click <strong>Install</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>4,974,400</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Like other smartphones, Android devices occasionally encounter glitches when playing video files.

Connect your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra to the computer and choose the Android Repair mode, and hit the Start button to begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="fix android not receiving texts with Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will have to provide information about your device, including the brand, name, model, country, and carrier.

Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultras because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p><em>Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can’t even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.</p><h2 id="Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone"><a href="#Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone"></a>Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone</h2><p>If the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue. Usually, there is an option on the iPhone where they can send texts as iMessage and simple messages. If the iPhone user sends the text as iMessage, then it will not show up on the Android device. To resolve this, you have to follow the steps below:</p><p>Taking the iPhone in hand makes sure that you are connected to a network. Open settings and scroll to look for the Message option. Toggle the bar next to the iMessage option to turn it off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/deactivate-imessages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check iphone message"                ></p><p>If the FaceTime option is also on, you might have to deactivate that too to send messages and calls as regular ones.</p><h2 id="Part-11-Update-Your-Android"><a href="#Part-11-Update-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 11: Update Your Android"></a>Part 11: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-update/samsung-update.html" >Update Your Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Updating the operating system to the latest Android version can fix some system errors which may cause the “Android not receiving texts” issue because the latest version always brings a better user experience and fix the know bugs.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Now you know several methods that can work if the Android messaging app is not working.  If you experience this kind of issue with your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, then you are most likely to resolve them with these fixes.

This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup.

Connect your Nokia C12 Plus to the computer and choose the Android Repair mode, and hit the Start button to begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="fix android not receiving texts with Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will have to provide information about your device, including the brand, name, model, country, and carrier.

Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Nokia C12 Plus is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Nokia C12 Plus phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Nokia C12 Pluss because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Nokia C12 Plus is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Nokia C12 Plus is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Nokia C12 Plus device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Nokia C12 Plus, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p><em>Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can’t even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.</p><h2 id="Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone"><a href="#Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone"></a>Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone</h2><p>If the Nokia C12 Plus phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue. Usually, there is an option on the iPhone where they can send texts as iMessage and simple messages. If the iPhone user sends the text as iMessage, then it will not show up on the Android device. To resolve this, you have to follow the steps below:</p><p>Taking the iPhone in hand makes sure that you are connected to a network. Open settings and scroll to look for the Message option. Toggle the bar next to the iMessage option to turn it off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/deactivate-imessages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check iphone message"                ></p><p>If the FaceTime option is also on, you might have to deactivate that too to send messages and calls as regular ones.</p><h2 id="Part-11-Update-Your-Android"><a href="#Part-11-Update-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 11: Update Your Android"></a>Part 11: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-update/samsung-update.html" >Update Your Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Updating the operating system to the latest Android version can fix some system errors which may cause the “Android not receiving texts” issue because the latest version always brings a better user experience and fix the know bugs.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Now you know several methods that can work if the Android messaging app is not working.  If you experience this kind of issue with your Nokia C12 Plus, then you are most likely to resolve them with these fixes.

It’s no surprise that smartphone touchscreens are one of the most common components to fail, given their delicate glass construction. However, a <strong><strong>part of the touch screen not working</strong></strong> on your Realme C55 does not necessarily mean it is a hardware issue. There could be other reasons why your Android’s touch screen stopped responding.</p><p>If your phone’s touchscreen frequently fails to respond, there are several things you can try before calling a professional. This article will reveal those proven fixes you can easily perform independently.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Part-of-My-Screen-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Part-of-My-Screen-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working"></a>Part 1. Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working</h2><p>There are two possible causes as to why your phone’s touch screen is not working. One is the touch screen may have been damaged, and the other is the Realme C55 device may be experiencing technical difficulties.</p><p>If you drop your phone and it becomes stuck against something, the touch screen’s connectivity may fail. Only a part of the touch screen may sometimes become damaged and unresponsive. That may also occur when there is a technical failure, such as the phone hanging. A <strong><strong>part of the touch screen not working</strong></strong> can occur when malware is downloaded or when phone settings are changed.</p><p>Now, the problem can affect any Android phone, and users may encounter the following error messages on their respective phone models:</p><ul><li>Realme C55 P40 lite <strong><strong>half touch screen not working</strong></strong></li><li>Nexus touch screen not working</li><li>LG screen is unresponsive to touch</li><li>Realme C55 <strong><strong>left side of the screen is not working</strong></strong></li><li>Redmi’s whole screen is unresponsive to touch</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Types-of-Touch-Screen-Issues-and-What-You-Should-Check-Before-Fixing"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Types-of-Touch-Screen-Issues-and-What-You-Should-Check-Before-Fixing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Different Types of Touch Screen Issues and What You Should Check Before Fixing"></a>Part 2. Different Types of Touch Screen Issues and What You Should Check Before Fixing</h2><p>You may experience a variety of touch screens not working on Android issues:</p><ul><li>A certain <strong><strong>part of the touch screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li><li>Your touches do not register on the touch screen.</li><li>The touch screen incorrectly responds to your touch.</li><li><strong><strong>Half touch screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li><li>The touch screen becomes frozen or hangs.</li><li>The screen flashes, flickers, or remains blank.</li><li>The<strong><strong>left side of the phone screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p>Before proceeding to how to fix an unresponsive touch screen on an Android device, you should complete the following steps:</p><ul><li>Examine the screen of your device. Check to see if it is cracked or chipped.</li><li>If the screen is damaged, it must be replaced.</li><li>Remove the Realme C55 device cover and screen protector if they are not damaged.</li><li>If there is a sticker on the Realme C55 device screen, you must remove it.</li><li>Before continuing, make sure your screen is spotless.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Fix-Part-of-the-Touch-Screen-Not-Working-No-Physical-Damage"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Fix-Part-of-the-Touch-Screen-Not-Working-No-Physical-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)"></a>Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)</h2><p>If you have already tried running the Realme C55 device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Realme C55’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.</p><h3 id="Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Restart Your Device"></a>Restart Your Device</h3><p>When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Hold the “Power” button until the Realme C55 device turns off.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG"                      alt="restart android with power button"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> When the Realme C55 device turns off, wait a few seconds.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Realme C55 device.</p><p>Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.</p><h3 id="Turn-On-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Turn-On-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Turn On Safe Mode"></a>Turn On Safe Mode</h3><p>You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.</p><p>If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> To force a restart, press and hold the Realme C55 device’s “Power” button for an extended period.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> When you let go of the “Power” button, press and hold the “Volume Down” button. After that, a “Safe Mode” label will appear in your screen’s lower-left corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-2.JPG"                      alt="turn-on-safe-mode-android"                ></p><h3 id="Turn-Off-Developer-Options"><a href="#Turn-Off-Developer-Options" class="headerlink" title="Turn Off Developer Options"></a>Turn Off Developer Options</h3><p>Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.</p><p>If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Launch the <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select the <strong><strong>System</strong></strong> menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Advanced options menu, then select Developer Options.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> You will then find the switch to turn it on or off. Disable itby toggling the button off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-3.PNG"                      alt="turn off developer options in android"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 5:</strong></strong> Restart your device to check if the part of the touch screen not working issue has been resolved.</p><h3 id="Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings"><a href="#Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Device to Factory Settings"></a>Reset Device to Factory Settings</h3><p>Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Go to <strong>Find My Device</strong> from any d<strong><strong>evice</strong></strong> and sign in to the Google account associated with the damaged screen device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> After successfully logging in, you will see your device’s name. Select the <strong><strong>Erase Device</strong></strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-4.JPG"                      alt="google find my device feature"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Confirm by pressing the <strong><strong>Erase Device</strong></strong> button.</p><p><strong><strong>Tip:</strong></strong> Since all your data will be removed, it’s recommended to <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/"><u>back up your data</u></a> first before resetting your device to factory settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-5.JPG"                      alt="erase device to factory reset android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Fix-Using-a-Third-Party-App-–-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Fix-Using-a-Third-Party-App-–-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.</p><p>Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn’t help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> happens and explore solutions that work for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android"></a>Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android</h2><p>First of all, what does <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> mean? To answer this question, it’s essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.</p><p>SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user’s device and a website’s server.</p><p>The error message appears when there’s a problem with the SSL&#x2F;TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user’s device and the server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Your connection is not private error on Android."                ></p><p>Some common factors that could trigger the <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;</strong></li></ol><p>Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;</strong></li></ol><p>This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>No HTTPS enforcement;</strong></li></ol><p>Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn’t turn on the “force HTTPS” option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.</p><p>So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.</p><p>Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That’s why when you get the “your connection is not private” message on Android, you can’t access the website.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean"><a href="#Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean"></a>Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean</h2><p>When <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong> shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.</p><ol><li><strong>ERR_CERT_SYMANTEC_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate</strong></li></ol><p>This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.</p><p>As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website’s SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate</strong></li></ol><p>The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID: Date and time mismatch</strong></li></ol><p>This error code points to a discrepancy between your Realme C55’s date and time settings and the information on the website’s SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device’s date and time settings should resolve this issue.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem</strong></li></ol><p>This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website’s SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue.

Therefore, it is advised to always use the Vivo V27 device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn’t damage your device or your adapter.</p><p>It is also very commonly observed that the charging end of the cable which gets connected to the charging port of the Vivo V27 device gets damaged and prevents the current from flowing to the phone&#x2F;tablet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459762305.jpg"                      alt="charging cable"                ></p><h3 id="2-Check-clean-charging-port"><a href="#2-Check-clean-charging-port" class="headerlink" title="2.

Check&#x2F;clean charging port</h3><p>The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone&#x2F;tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Vivo V27 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459938188.jpg"                      alt="check charging port"                ></p><p>The best way to take this problem is to clean the port with a blunt pin or a soft bristle unused toothbrush.

Check&#x2F;replace charging adapter</h3><p>This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable&#x2F;USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Vivo V27 won’t charge the issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985010302112.jpg"                      alt="check charging adapter"                ></p><h3 id="4-Try-another-power-source"><a href="#4-Try-another-power-source" class="headerlink" title="4.

It means to switch from one power source to another or use a more efficient and suitable power source. Laptops and PCs charge slower than a direct power source, i.e., a wall socket. Sometimes, the charging speed is slower, and the battery is draining. In such a scenario, choose to charge your device by directly plugging it into a socket on the wall to never experience My Vivo V27 won’t charge problem.</p><h3 id="5-Clear-device-Cache"><a href="#5-Clear-device-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5.

If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Honor Magic Vs 2 is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Honor Magic Vs 2 device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Honor Magic Vs 2, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p><em>Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Gionee F3 Pro. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Gionee F3 Pro or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Gionee F3 Pro&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Gionee F3 Pro reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Gionee F3 Pro Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

And when there are the files or data that are corrupted in the cache, this might raise the “Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped” error. Therefore, you need to clear the WhatsApp data if the above method went futile. Here are the steps.</p><ul><li>Open “Settings” and go to “App Manager” or “Apps &amp; Notifications” or “Applications”.</li><li>Now, from the list of all applications, choose “WhatsApp”.</li><li>Click on “Storage” and tap “Clear Data”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/clear-whatsapp-data.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix cache conflict"                ></p><h2 id="Cause-3-WhatsApp-components-corruption"><a href="#Cause-3-WhatsApp-components-corruption" class="headerlink" title="Cause 3: WhatsApp components corruption"></a>Cause 3: WhatsApp components corruption</h2><p>A lot of times, the WhatsApp crashes due to the corrupted components of WhatsApp. In such case, all you need to do is uninstall and install the WhatsApp again. This is how you do it.</p><ul><li>Uninstall the app right away from your Homescreen or from the “Settings” &gt; “Applications” &gt; “All” &gt; “WhatsApp” &gt; “Uninstall” (for some phones).</li><li>Go to “Play Store” and search “WhatsApp” on the search bar.</li><li>Tap on it and start downloading followed by installing it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/install-whatsapp.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix component corruption"                ></p><h2 id="Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone"></a>Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone</h2><p>Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the Gionee F3 Pro device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.</p><ul><li>Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage. Make sure it is enough i.e. at least 100 to 200MB.</li><li>Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.</li></ul><h2 id="Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked"><a href="#Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked" class="headerlink" title="Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked"></a>Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked</h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Android device and Gmail account go hand in hand. To run the Gionee F3 Pro device smoothly, it is always asked to enter your Gmail address for further configurations. And when WhatsApp stops on your device, the reason might be your Gmail account. Most probably it is not valid now or maybe hacked. If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.</p><ul><li>Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.</li><li>Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/log-out-gmail.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix gmail account"                ></p><p>Now, you can login again and check if WhatsApp works or not.</p><h2 id="Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone"></a>Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone</h2><p>If still nothing works and your WhatsApp keeps stopping, most likely the reason is the incompatibility of your WhatsApp with your device.

If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time.

Why Is Your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully.

This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Xiaomi Redmi K70 when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Xiaomi Redmi K70 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery!

This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Xiaomi Redmi K70 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Xiaomi Redmi K70 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.

It’s a powerful OS that gives you the utmost freedom and flexibility, allowing you to customize your phone to suit your needs.</p><p>However, regardless of the capabilities of Android phones and the features that come with their OS, just like any other smartphone, they’re prone to glitches and annoying issues – especially with their video files.</p><p>You may encounter <strong>videos not playing on your Lava Agni 2 5G</strong> more frequently than you like. Whether it’s video files you’ve recorded using your phone or files you’ve downloaded, this glitch can get pretty annoying pretty fast. Fortunately, there are several solutions you could try to fix it.</p><p>See what you can do if <strong>videos won’t play on your Android.</strong></p><h2 id="Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android"><a href="#Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android" class="headerlink" title="Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?"></a>Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-2.jpg"                      alt="person recording cityscape using their android"                ></p><p>Considering how most smartphone manufacturers tend to emphasize the unbelievable quality of their cameras, perfect night modes, seamless slow-motion recordings, superb resolution, and more, you’d expect all images and videos to function flawlessly on your Android. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.</p><p>Occasionally, you could find that the videos you access from your gallery won’t play, sending you the message that “video cannot be played” or “can’t play video.” Other times, you might find that YouTube videos won’t load correctly or your downloaded videos won’t open in your media player.</p><p>There could be a wide variety of reasons that is happening, including:</p><ul><li>Corrupted video</li><li>Corrupted SD card</li><li>Outdated media player</li><li>Outdated OS</li><li>Incomplete download from the source</li><li>Low storage</li><li>Video downloaded from a suspicious source</li></ul><p>An array of hardware and software issues could lead to you being unable to play videos on your Android. However, that doesn’t mean you should immediately send your device for repairs or delete the videos that won’t play. There might be a few better solutions you could try.</p><h2 id="What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone"><a href="#What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone"></a>What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone</h2><p>Since there are many reasons for having problems with videos not playing on your Android, you could also try many solutions.</p><h3 id="1-Do-a-Factory-Reset"><a href="#1-Do-a-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Factory Reset"></a>1. Do a Factory Reset</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-3.jpg"                      alt="person holding a black android"                ></p><p>While a factory reset shouldn’t always be the first solution you go to, it can usually prove to be the most effective one.</p><p>A factory reset, aka a master reset or a hard reset, returns all your software configurations to the original state when the phone was first manufactured. In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-Lava-Agni-2-5G"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Lava-Agni-2-5G" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your Lava Agni 2 5G"></a>2. Restart Your Lava Agni 2 5G</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.</p><h3 id="4-Check-the-Internet-Connection"><a href="#4-Check-the-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="4. Check the Internet Connection"></a>4. Check the Internet Connection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg"                      alt="pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off"                ></p><p>If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.</p><p>Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.</p><p>You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network settings &gt; Reset settings</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-6.jpg"                      alt="android network reset"                ></p><h3 id="5-Clear-the-Cache"><a href="#5-Clear-the-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Clear the Cache"></a>5. Clear the Cache</h3><p>The cache stores a copy of your most commonly used data, helping decrease loading time and improve your phone’s performance. However, too much cache data can take up too much space and cause data corruption, preventing you from accessing some of your apps.</p><p>On average, you should clear your phone’s cache every few months to ensure that everything runs smoothly. If you encounter issues with your videos not playing on Android, clearing the cache could be just the fix you need.</p><p>To clear the cache from your apps, you’ll want to go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps.</strong> From there, select the app you want to remove the cache from, scroll down to <strong>Storage</strong>, then choose <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-7.jpg"                      alt="clear cache on android apps"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Android-OS"><a href="#6-Update-Android-OS" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Android OS"></a>6. Update Android OS</h3><p>An outdated Android OS is usually the culprit behind many bugs and glitches you may encounter on your phone. It can prevent you from playing video files, accessing apps, taking photos, and more. It can lead to data corruption and loss, expose you to malware and cyberattacks, and compromise phone performance.</p><p>Regularly updating your OS to its latest version is always in your best interest. It can solve the problem of your videos not playing and protect you and your sensitive data.</p><h3 id="7-Repair-Your-Android-OS"><a href="#7-Repair-Your-Android-OS" class="headerlink" title="7. Repair Your Android OS"></a>7. Repair Your Android OS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-8.jpg"                      alt="person holding a phone with black screen"                ></p><p>You might already have the latest version of Android OS, but that still doesn’t mean your OS is functioning as it should. Maybe your phone was interrupted while downloading or installing the new OS version. Maybe your phone had underlying OS issues, or you accidentally downloaded files you shouldn’t have. Whatever the case is, if your videos don’t play due to an OS problem, you’ll need to repair your OS.</p><p>The best way to do it is with a reliable Android OS repair solution like Wondershare Dr.Fone.</p><p>Fast, efficient, and powerful, Wondershare Dr.Fone can repair your Lava Agni 2 5G in several simple steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your PC.</li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to <strong>Toolbox</strong>, then use a cable to connect your Lava Agni 2 5G to your PC.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="wondershare dr.fone toolbox"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select <strong>System Repair &gt; Android</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4</strong>: In the new window, select <strong>Start</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-1.png"                      alt="wondershare dr.fone android repair"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Fill in information about your phone’s <strong>Brand, Name, Model, Country,</strong> and <strong>Carrier</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 6</strong>: Agree with the warning and select <strong>Next</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="wondershare dr.fone device information"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7</strong>: Follow the on-screen instructions to put your device in <strong>Download Mode</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 8</strong>: Wondershare Dr.Fone will automatically start downloading the necessary firmware, so wait for the process to finish.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-5.png"                      alt="dr.fone downloading firmware"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 9</strong>: When the download is complete, select <strong>Fix Now</strong> to install it.</li><li><strong>Step 10</strong>: Type <strong>000000</strong>, then select <strong>Confirm</strong>to continue fixing your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-7.png"                      alt="wondershare dr.fone system repair confirmation"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 11</strong>: Wait for the <strong>Repairing Now</strong>process to finish.</li><li><strong>Step 12</strong>: Once the process is complete, click <strong>Done</strong>.</li></ul><p>If the reason your videos wouldn’t play on your Lava Agni 2 5G was a fault in the OS, everything should be functioning well after repairing your phone with Wondershare Dr.Fone.</p><p>Remember that repairing your device with Wondershare Dr.Fone might result in data loss.

Not every update is there simply to introduce new features.</p><p>To check whether you’re using the latest version of your video player, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps</strong>. Find your video player app, tap it, and scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the version installed on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-14.jpg"                      alt="android app version"                ></p><h3 id="9-Clear-Cookies-and-Browsing-Data"><a href="#9-Clear-Cookies-and-Browsing-Data" class="headerlink" title="9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data"></a>9. Clear Cookies and Browsing Data</h3><p>If online videos are causing problems, not your recorded or downloaded ones, you might be due for a quick cookie and browsing data clearing.</p><p>Cookies are usually there to improve the user experience, allowing you to load websites faster and enjoy improved performance. However, if your cookies and browsing data occupy too much space, they could pose problems.</p><p>You’ll first need to launch your mobile browser to clear cookies and browsing data. If you’re using Google Chrome, the process is simple and streamlined. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner and go to <strong>Settings</strong>. From there, go to <strong>Privacy and security &gt; Clear browsing data &gt; Clear data</strong>.</p><h3 id="10-Reinstall-Video-Apps"><a href="#10-Reinstall-Video-Apps" class="headerlink" title="10. Reinstall Video Apps"></a>10. Reinstall Video Apps</h3><p>If you still have issues with videos not playing on your Lava Agni 2 5G, you could try deleting and reinstalling your video apps.

We found many Android users have increasingly expressed their frustrations with this recurring problem while browsing on the internet.</p><p>Usually, you can just reload the page to fix the error. But in case it doesn’t help, you may need to look for more advanced solutions. In the following discussion, we will delve into why this <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> happens and explore solutions that work for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Addressing-Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android"></a>Part 1: Addressing Your Connection Is Not Private on Android</h2><p>First of all, what does <strong>“your connection is not private” on Android</strong> mean? To answer this question, it’s essential to understand that this error is often associated with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol issues.</p><p>SSL is a cryptographic protocol created to establish a secure communication channel over the internet. Its primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user’s device and a website’s server.</p><p>The error message appears when there’s a problem with the SSL&#x2F;TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate of the website you are trying to access. This certificate is a digital document that authenticates the website and encrypts the data transmitted between the user’s device and the server.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Your connection is not private error on Android."                ></p><p>Some common factors that could trigger the <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;</strong></li></ol><p>Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;</strong></li></ol><p>This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>No HTTPS enforcement;</strong></li></ol><p>Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn’t turn on the “force HTTPS” option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.</p><p>So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.</p><p>Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That’s why when you get the “your connection is not private” message on Android, you can’t access the website.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean"><a href="#Part-2-What-The-Error-Codes-in-“Your-Connection-Is-Not-Private”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean"></a>Part 2: What The Error Codes in “Your Connection Is Not Private” Mean</h2><p>When <strong>“your connection is not private” on Chrome Android error</strong> shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.</p><ol><li><strong>ERR_CERT_SYMANTEC_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate</strong></li></ol><p>This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.</p><p>As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website’s SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate</strong></li></ol><p>The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID: Date and time mismatch</strong></li></ol><p>This error code points to a discrepancy between your Lava Agni 2 5G’s date and time settings and the information on the website’s SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device’s date and time settings should resolve this issue.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem</strong></li></ol><p>This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website’s SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue.

Just say, “Hey, Google, take a screenshot,” Google Assistant will capture the screen and save it to your gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-09.jpg"                      alt="google assistant command"                ></p><p>Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots</p><p>You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:</p><ul><li>Screenshot Easy</li><li>Screenshot Tile</li><li>Screen Master: Screenshot Markup</li></ul><p>Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.</p><p>Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device</p><p>If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Poco F5 5G device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.</p><p>Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions</p><p>Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.</p><p>Screen Mirroring</p><p>Smart View allows you to display your Poco F5 5G device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down the top of the screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>Smart View</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap <strong>Start Now</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-10.jpg"                      alt="cast samsung phone using smart view"                ></p><p>Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Poco F5 5G Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.</p><p>Use Disable Flag Secure Magisk Module</p><p>Still experiencing the error message, “<strong>Can’t take screenshot due to security policy?” Bypass Android</strong> phone error like this using a module.</p><p>The module patches the Android framework to remove the FLAG_SECURE flag from apps. It is a relatively simple process but requires root access and Magisk. This module will turn off the security flag to take screenshots in Incognito mode and other apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-11.jpg"                      alt="magiskzip disable flag secure module"                ></p><p>Authors Verdict</p><p>There are a few ways to bypass screenshot restrictions on Android apps and websites, but some methods are more complicated than others. All methods should work, but if you think your device has been compromised, it is important to check if it is a system issue.</p><p>You can use a third-party tool like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> without rooting your device.
