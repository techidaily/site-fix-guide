They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Xiaomi Redmi K70 is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Xiaomi Redmi K70 is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Xiaomi Redmi K70 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Xiaomi Redmi K70s.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device. So if your Xiaomi Redmi K70 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device’s animation type and speed on your Xiaomi Redmi K70 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Xiaomi Redmi K70 to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 is running slow and freezing, the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device’s software is probably outdated.

It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Lags"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Lags" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When My Xiaomi Redmi K70 Lags?"></a>What to Do When My Xiaomi Redmi K70 Lags?</h2><p>It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow.

Restart your Android and try to update again"></a>Method 1. Restart your Android and try to update again</h3><p>In most cases, restarting the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device can simply do the trick. When you restart the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device, most of the issues get eliminated making the Xiaomi Redmi K70 device perform better than before. Also, it is all about RAM. While you restart your device, the RAM gets cleared. As a result, the apps work properly.

Once restarted, try to update again and see if the results are positive.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Uninstall-Google-Play-Services-Updates-and-Reattempt-the-Update"><a href="#Method-2-Uninstall-Google-Play-Services-Updates-and-Reattempt-the-Update" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.

But if not, you can go to the next fix.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Clear-Google-Play-Services-cache"><a href="#Method-6-Clear-Google-Play-Services-cache" class="headerlink" title="Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache"></a>Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache</h3><p>If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason. If you don’t know, cache holds the app’s data temporarily so that it can remember the information when you next open the app. Many times, old cache files get corrupted. And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.</p><p>Here is how to clear Google Play Services cache:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/clear-cache.jpg"                      alt="set correct date and time"                ></p><ul><li>Launch “Settings” on your phone and go to “Apps &amp; Notifications” or “Application” or “Application Manager”.</li><li>Now, from all the apps’ list, choose “Google Play Services”.</li><li>On opening it, tap “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-7-Boot-into-download-mode-to-clear-cache-of-whole-phone"><a href="#Method-7-Boot-into-download-mode-to-clear-cache-of-whole-phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 7.

For this, you need to go to the download mode or recovery mode of your device. Every device has its own steps for this.

They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Pro-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Pro-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pros.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device. So if your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device’s animation type and speed on your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro is running slow and freezing, the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues"></a>Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues</h3><p>Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro is running slow and freezing.</p><h3 id="Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable"><a href="#Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable" class="headerlink" title="Your Internet Connection is Unstable"></a>Your Internet Connection is Unstable</h3><p>Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too.

It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Pro-Lags"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70-Pro-Lags" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When My Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro Lags?"></a>What to Do When My Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro Lags?</h2><p>It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow.

Below are some remedies that can help you get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Reboot-Your-Phone"><a href="#Solution-1-Reboot-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Reboot Your Phone"></a>Solution 1: Reboot Your Phone</h3><p>Sometimes, minor bugs can give your device a hard time.

They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-A2-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-A2-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Xiaomi Redmi A2+s.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device. So if your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s animation type and speed on your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is running slow and freezing, the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues"></a>Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues</h3><p>Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is running slow and freezing.</p><h3 id="Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable"><a href="#Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable" class="headerlink" title="Your Internet Connection is Unstable"></a>Your Internet Connection is Unstable</h3><p>Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-A2-Lags"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-My-Xiaomi-Redmi-A2-Lags" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When My Xiaomi Redmi A2+ Lags?"></a>What to Do When My Xiaomi Redmi A2+ Lags?</h2><p>It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow. However, it can still cause some delays and inconvenience for users. So it’s really important to take action when you notice some anomalies with its speed and performance. Below are some remedies that can help you get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Reboot-Your-Phone"><a href="#Solution-1-Reboot-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Reboot Your Phone"></a>Solution 1: Reboot Your Phone</h3><p>Sometimes, minor bugs can give your device a hard time. It can be the reason why your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ is running slow and freezing. If that’s the case, rebooting your phone might help a lot.

You may uninstall the apps you rarely use to free up some space. Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your home screen, find the app you wish to uninstall. Hold its icon until an option list appears.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click <strong>Uninstall.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-phone-running-slow-and-freezing-2.JPG"                      alt="uninstall android apps"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click <strong>Ok</strong> if it asks you to confirm the action.</li></ul><p>Wait until the app icon disappears from the home screen.</p><h3 id="Solution-3-Set-the-Animation-Speed-a-Little-Faster"><a href="#Solution-3-Set-the-Animation-Speed-a-Little-Faster" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Set the Animation Speed a Little Faster"></a>Solution 3: Set the Animation Speed a Little Faster</h3><p>Altering the animation speed is not that dangerous. However, it can sometimes interfere with the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s smoothness if set too slow.

This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue.

Here’s how.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Placing your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Xiaomi Redmi A2+.</p><p><strong>Step 1A</strong>: Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button and <strong>Volume Down</strong> buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1B</strong>: If your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ still has a <strong>Home</strong> button, press and hold the <strong>Home</strong> button and the <strong>Power</strong> button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1C</strong>: If step 1A did not put your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the <strong>Volume</strong> buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset, and confirm your choice with the <strong>Power</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 02"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for the process to complete and for your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to restart automatically.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen"><a href="#Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen"></a>Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen</h3><p>If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the <strong>touchscreen problem,</strong> it could be the screen itself.

You should have your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg"                      alt="图像"                >“</p><h3 id="Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center"><a href="#Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center" class="headerlink" title="Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center"></a>Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center</h3><p>Your <strong>phone touch problem</strong> might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Honor Magic 5’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Honor Magic 5.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Reset Android to factory settings"></a>4. Reset Android to factory settings</h3><p>If the previous methods don’t work, you might need to do a <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html"><u>factory reset on your Honor Magic 5</u></a>. But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.</li></ul><p>Please be mindful that performing a factory reset on Android will reset your Android completely to its initial state.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-4.jpg"                      alt="Perform a factory reset on Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software"></a>Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software</h2><p><strong>Missing app icons on Android</strong> can sometimes be a result of errors in your Android system launcher, causing inconvenience and potential disruptions to your device’s operation.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Honor Magic 5 Pro’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Honor Magic 5 Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Reset Android to factory settings"></a>4. Reset Android to factory settings</h3><p>If the previous methods don’t work, you might need to do a <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html"><u>factory reset on your Honor Magic 5 Pro</u></a>. But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.</li></ul><p>Please be mindful that performing a factory reset on Android will reset your Android completely to its initial state.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-4.jpg"                      alt="Perform a factory reset on Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software"></a>Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software</h2><p><strong>Missing app icons on Android</strong> can sometimes be a result of errors in your Android system launcher, causing inconvenience and potential disruptions to your device’s operation.

Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Honor Magic 5 Pro.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Honor Magic 5 Pro. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Honor Magic 5 Pro right where you are, without needing to take the Honor Magic 5 Pro device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Honor Magic 5 Pro device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do.

That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Honor 90 Lite’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Honor 90 Lite.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3.

This is how you do it.</p><ul><li>Uninstall the app right away from your Homescreen or from the “Settings” &gt; “Applications” &gt; “All” &gt; “WhatsApp” &gt; “Uninstall” (for some phones).</li><li>Go to “Play Store” and search “WhatsApp” on the search bar.</li><li>Tap on it and start downloading followed by installing it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/install-whatsapp.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix component corruption"                ></p><h2 id="Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone"></a>Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone</h2><p>Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the Honor 90 Lite device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.</p><ul><li>Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage. Make sure it is enough i.e. at least 100 to 200MB.</li><li>Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked"><a href="#Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked" class="headerlink" title="Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked"></a>Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked</h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Android device and Gmail account go hand in hand. To run the Honor 90 Lite device smoothly, it is always asked to enter your Gmail address for further configurations. And when WhatsApp stops on your device, the reason might be your Gmail account. Most probably it is not valid now or maybe hacked. If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.</p><ul><li>Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.</li><li>Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/log-out-gmail.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix gmail account"                ></p><p>Now, you can login again and check if WhatsApp works or not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone"></a>Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone</h2><p>If still nothing works and your WhatsApp keeps stopping, most likely the reason is the incompatibility of your WhatsApp with your device. In such case, the thing that comes to your rescue is mod WhatsApp version like GBWhatsApp. It is a mod app which is similar to WhatsApp but in a more modified way. With this, a user gets more functionalities and customizable settings when compared to WhatsApp.</p><p>If you’re wondering how you can find this app and install, you should keep reading.</p><p><strong>To find GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Since you can look for this mod app on the Play Store, here are some of the other secure places from where you can download apk file for this GBWhatsApp. Note down these websites to get GBWhatsApp downloaded if WhatsApp has stopped.</p><ul><li>Latest Mod APKs</li><li>UptoDown</li><li>Android APKs Free</li><li>Soft Alien</li><li>OpenTechInfo</li></ul><p><strong>To Install GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Now that you have decided where to download the apk file, these are the following steps that you should follow to install it on your phone. Please have a look:</p><ul><li>Firstly, open “Settings” on your device and go to “Security”. Turn the “Unknown Sources” option. Doing this will let you install the apps from other locations than Play Store.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/install-gbwhatsapp-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix by installing gbwhatsapp"                ></p><ul><li>Using the browser on your phone, download the app from any of the aforementioned website.</li><li>Launch the GBWhatsApp apk and follow the onscreen instruction in order to install.

It’s a powerful OS that gives you the utmost freedom and flexibility, allowing you to customize your phone to suit your needs.</p><p>However, regardless of the capabilities of Android phones and the features that come with their OS, just like any other smartphone, they’re prone to glitches and annoying issues – especially with their video files.</p><p>You may encounter <strong>videos not playing on your Honor 70 Lite 5G</strong> more frequently than you like.

In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-Honor-70-Lite-5G"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Honor-70-Lite-5G" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your Honor 70 Lite 5G"></a>2. Restart Your Honor 70 Lite 5G</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.</p><h3 id="4-Check-the-Internet-Connection"><a href="#4-Check-the-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="4. Check the Internet Connection"></a>4. Check the Internet Connection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg"                      alt="pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off"                ></p><p>If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.</p><p>Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.</p><p>You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset.

After this, you can again sign in and then check if the problem is gone or not.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/remove-account-2.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - remove account"                ></p><h2 id="Problem-5-Stuck-in-sending"><a href="#Problem-5-Stuck-in-sending" class="headerlink" title="Problem 5: Stuck in sending"></a>Problem 5: Stuck in sending</h2><p>Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.</p><h3 id="Try-Alternative-Gmail-Address"><a href="#Try-Alternative-Gmail-Address" class="headerlink" title="Try Alternative Gmail Address"></a>Try Alternative Gmail Address</h3><p>First of all, if Gmail is not working due to stuck in sending issue, we advise you to make use of some other Gmail address to send the mail. If the problem still occurs, jump to the next solution.</p><h3 id="Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Check Network Connection"></a>Check Network Connection</h3><p>As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:</p><ol><li>Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.</li><li>Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.</li><li>Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.</li></ol><p>Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Check-Attachments"><a href="#Check-Attachments" class="headerlink" title="Check Attachments"></a>Check Attachments</h3><p>Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.</p><h2 id="Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue"><a href="#Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue"></a>Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue</h2><p>Many times, the users get the error that says “Account not synced” while they try to work with Gmail.

If not, create it straight away. As we also mentioned in one of the above solutions, you can either delete the unnecessary files or transfer the important files to the PC to make the space in the phone. Go along with this tip and see if it works.</p><h3 id="Check-Gmail-Sync-Settings-1"><a href="#Check-Gmail-Sync-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Check Gmail Sync Settings"></a>Check Gmail Sync Settings</h3><p>As another solution, check Gmail sync settings to get the issue fixed.</p><ol><li><p>Simply open Gmail and hit the menu icon which is three horizontal lines on the top.</p></li><li><p>Go to “Settings” and choose your account.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="Gmail not responding - go to settings"                ></p></li><li><p>See the tiny box beside “Sync Gmail” and check it if it is not.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-2.jpg"                      alt="Gmail not responding - sync gmail"                ></p><h3 id="Restart-the-Honor-70-Lite-5G-device-2"><a href="#Restart-the-Honor-70-Lite-5G-device-2" class="headerlink" title="Restart the Honor 70 Lite 5G device"></a>Restart the Honor 70 Lite 5G device</h3><p>If the above method went futile, simply restart your device.

So, make sure you wipe out the items you no longer needed on your device and create some room so that the Gmail responds nicely and won’t be running slow anymore.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Update-Gmail-App"><a href="#Update-Gmail-App" class="headerlink" title="Update Gmail App"></a>Update Gmail App</h3><p>As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated.

To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device.

One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there.

Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4.

But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Gionee F3 Pro’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Gionee F3 Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Reset Android to factory settings"></a>4. Reset Android to factory settings</h3><p>If the previous methods don’t work, you might need to do a <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html"><u>factory reset on your Gionee F3 Pro</u></a>. But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.</li></ul><p>Please be mindful that performing a factory reset on Android will reset your Android completely to its initial state.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-4.jpg"                      alt="Perform a factory reset on Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software"></a>Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software</h2><p><strong>Missing app icons on Android</strong> can sometimes be a result of errors in your Android system launcher, causing inconvenience and potential disruptions to your device’s operation.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your HTC U23’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your HTC U23.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4.

But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset.

In fact, this is the first thing I’d recommend you to try if you come up with an Error code 920. Just try this whenever you get any error.</p><p>Step 1 - Go to the application that you got the error with.</p><p>Step 2 - Open that application download page on the Play store.</p><p>Step 3 - Uninstall it or even uninstall all the update (If the error came when you were updating the application).</p><p>Step 4 - Now you clear the task manager and try installing it once again. If the play store error 920 doesn’t come then you have solved the problem and now wasn’t that easy. So it’s always best to try this step before doing anything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022232651.jpg"                      alt="error code 920-install apps"                ></p><h4 id="METHOD-3-Switching-off-and-turning-the-wifi-cellular-data-on"><a href="#METHOD-3-Switching-off-and-turning-the-wifi-cellular-data-on" class="headerlink" title="METHOD 3: Switching off and turning the wifi (cellular data) on"></a><strong>METHOD 3: Switching off and turning the wifi (cellular data) on</strong></h4><p>This is another basic method in solving the play store error 920.

What you need to do is clear the cache and clear the data of the play store. This will get rid of the error code 920 the next time you download or update any application from the Google Play store.</p><p>Step 1 – Go to settings of your device.</p><p>Step 2 – Now find “Applications” option under the settings menu.

Go to play store and resume your download or update.</p><h4 id="METHOD-5-Removing-and-adding-back-your-Google-account"><a href="#METHOD-5-Removing-and-adding-back-your-Google-account" class="headerlink" title="METHOD 5: Removing and adding back your Google account"></a><strong>METHOD 5: Removing and adding back your Google account</strong></h4><p>It is best if you follow the order of the methods mentioned. Like, try each method in the given order until you get rid of the play store error 920. If you reach here then you truly must be in a desperate position to get rid of this error. The best and guaranteed way is to delete your Google account from your phone. By deleting what is meant here is to temporarily remove your account and the adding it in again.

Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps.

Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen.

Common Causes"></a>Part 1: Why Did My HTC U23 Pro Screen Go Black but Still Works? Common Causes</h2><p>Experiencing a <strong>cell phone blank screen</strong> is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A <strong>phone screen not turning on</strong> happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why <strong>your phone screen went black but still works.</strong></p><h3 id="A-Drained-Battery"><a href="#A-Drained-Battery" class="headerlink" title="A Drained Battery"></a>A Drained Battery</h3><p>The first thing that comes to mind when your <strong>phone screen suddenly goes black</strong> is you have a drained battery. Even though this is obvious, it’s still important to mention, as this is usually what most people encounter. To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-02.jpg"                      alt="drained iphone battery"                ></p><h3 id="App-Troubles"><a href="#App-Troubles" class="headerlink" title="App Troubles"></a>App Troubles</h3><p>If your <strong>phone is working, but the screen is black,</strong> there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.</p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>A potential reason why <strong>your phone screen went black but still works</strong> could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your HTC U23 Pro is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately.

Wait until you get the notification for completion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-8.png"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - start android repair"                ></p><h2 id="Cause-2-Cache-conflict"><a href="#Cause-2-Cache-conflict" class="headerlink" title="Cause 2: Cache conflict"></a>Cause 2: Cache conflict</h2><p>The purpose of Cache in a device is to keep the track of frequently used data and information of an application. And when there are the files or data that are corrupted in the cache, this might raise the “Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped” error. Therefore, you need to clear the WhatsApp data if the above method went futile. Here are the steps.</p><ul><li>Open “Settings” and go to “App Manager” or “Apps &amp; Notifications” or “Applications”.</li><li>Now, from the list of all applications, choose “WhatsApp”.</li><li>Click on “Storage” and tap “Clear Data”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/clear-whatsapp-data.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix cache conflict"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cause-3-WhatsApp-components-corruption"><a href="#Cause-3-WhatsApp-components-corruption" class="headerlink" title="Cause 3: WhatsApp components corruption"></a>Cause 3: WhatsApp components corruption</h2><p>A lot of times, the WhatsApp crashes due to the corrupted components of WhatsApp. In such case, all you need to do is uninstall and install the WhatsApp again. This is how you do it.</p><ul><li>Uninstall the app right away from your Homescreen or from the “Settings” &gt; “Applications” &gt; “All” &gt; “WhatsApp” &gt; “Uninstall” (for some phones).</li><li>Go to “Play Store” and search “WhatsApp” on the search bar.</li><li>Tap on it and start downloading followed by installing it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/install-whatsapp.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix component corruption"                ></p><h2 id="Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone"></a>Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone</h2><p>Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the HTC U23 Pro device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.</p><ul><li>Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage. Make sure it is enough i.e. at least 100 to 200MB.</li><li>Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.</li></ul><h2 id="Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked"><a href="#Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked" class="headerlink" title="Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked"></a>Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked</h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Android device and Gmail account go hand in hand. To run the HTC U23 Pro device smoothly, it is always asked to enter your Gmail address for further configurations. And when WhatsApp stops on your device, the reason might be your Gmail account. Most probably it is not valid now or maybe hacked. If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.</p><ul><li>Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.</li><li>Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/log-out-gmail.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix gmail account"                ></p><p>Now, you can login again and check if WhatsApp works or not.</p><h2 id="Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone"></a>Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone</h2><p>If still nothing works and your WhatsApp keeps stopping, most likely the reason is the incompatibility of your WhatsApp with your device. In such case, the thing that comes to your rescue is mod WhatsApp version like GBWhatsApp. It is a mod app which is similar to WhatsApp but in a more modified way. With this, a user gets more functionalities and customizable settings when compared to WhatsApp.</p><p>If you’re wondering how you can find this app and install, you should keep reading.</p><p><strong>To find GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Since you can look for this mod app on the Play Store, here are some of the other secure places from where you can download apk file for this GBWhatsApp. Note down these websites to get GBWhatsApp downloaded if WhatsApp has stopped.</p><ul><li>Latest Mod APKs</li><li>UptoDown</li><li>Android APKs Free</li><li>Soft Alien</li><li>OpenTechInfo</li></ul><p><strong>To Install GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Now that you have decided where to download the apk file, these are the following steps that you should follow to install it on your phone. Please have a look:</p><ul><li>Firstly, open “Settings” on your device and go to “Security”. Turn the “Unknown Sources” option. Doing this will let you install the apps from other locations than Play Store.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/install-gbwhatsapp-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix by installing gbwhatsapp"                ></p><ul><li>Using the browser on your phone, download the app from any of the aforementioned website.</li><li>Launch the GBWhatsApp apk and follow the onscreen instruction in order to install.

Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there.

The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3.

If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Honor X9a phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Honor X9as because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Honor X9a is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Honor X9a is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Honor X9a device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Honor X9a, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p>_Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can’t even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.</p><h2 id="Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone"><a href="#Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone"></a>Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone</h2><p>If the Honor X9a phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue. Usually, there is an option on the iPhone where they can send texts as iMessage and simple messages. If the iPhone user sends the text as iMessage, then it will not show up on the Android device. To resolve this, you have to follow the steps below:</p><p>Taking the iPhone in hand makes sure that you are connected to a network. Open settings and scroll to look for the Message option. Toggle the bar next to the iMessage option to turn it off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/deactivate-imessages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check iphone message"                ></p><p>If the FaceTime option is also on, you might have to deactivate that too to send messages and calls as regular ones.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-11-Update-Your-Android"><a href="#Part-11-Update-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 11: Update Your Android"></a>Part 11: Update Your Android</h2><p>Updating the operating system to the latest Android version can fix some system errors which may cause the “Android not receiving texts” issue because the latest version always brings a better user experience and fix the know bugs.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Now you know several methods that can work if the Android messaging app is not working.  If you experience this kind of issue with your Honor X9a, then you are most likely to resolve them with these fixes.

Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2.

The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3.

Why Is Your Honor X8b Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Honor X8b Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Honor X8b has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Honor X8b functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Honor X8b, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Honor X8b when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Honor X8b to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Honor X8b device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Honor X8b to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Honor X8b could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Honor X8b:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Honor X7b’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Honor X7b.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2.

Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3.

Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen.

Ensuring that SIM is not wet either and then putting it back into its place. If this works, then the SIM not working in Android was due to the dirt or moisture that was preventing proper contact between SIM card pins and smartphone circuit.</p><h3 id="2-3-Insert-the-SIM-card-correctly"><a href="#2-3-Insert-the-SIM-card-correctly" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly"></a>2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly</h3><p>If your SIM card was working properly until yet, there is a good possibility that the SIM card may have moved a bit from its actual location.

But if that’s not happening in your case and you’re wondering how to activate SIM card, make use of the three options below to enable activation:</p><ul><li>Call your carrier service provider</li><li>Send an SMS</li><li>Log on to your carrier’s website and look for the activation page over it.</li></ul><p>Note: The aforementioned options are straightforward and are quick ways to enable activation. It depends on your carrier network whether they support them.</p><h3 id="2-5-Contact-your-carrier"><a href="#2-5-Contact-your-carrier" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Contact your carrier"></a>2.5 Contact your carrier</h3><p>Even if your SIM isn’t activated, grab another working device to make a phone call to your carrier or network. Ensure, to explain the entire situation and the error message to them. Be patient while they investigate the issue.

Thanks to the dual SIM technology, you do not have to rush immediately to get it to check or repair. You can simply rule out this possibility by ejecting the SIM card from its original SIM slot and then replacing it into the other SIM card slot. If this solution did work out for you then it is obvious that the problem was with the SIM card slot that got corrupted. And hence, it was triggering SIM not responding issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/insert-sim-properly.jpg"                      alt="fix SIM not responding - try another slot"                ></p><h3 id="2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones"><a href="#2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones" class="headerlink" title="2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones"></a>2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones</h3><p>Or just in case, you’ve still no joy and the SIM not provisioned on Android message is bothering you.

To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Honor X50 GT’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article.

To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4.

But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset.

You should know how to recover your device by flashing a command line and also manually transfer important files to your device.</li><li>Make a backup of your device. This is obvious but most people fail to adhere to it. At the very least you can get back all your files and settings to transfer to a new phone.</li><li>Keep a full Nandroid backup on your phone</li><li>Keep another backup on your PC which you can access should anything go wrong with the Custom ROM installation</li><li>Know how to hard reset your device.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Honor V Purse’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Honor V Purse.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4.
