    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reliable-User-Guide-to-Fix-Infinix-Hot-40-Pro-Running-Slow-and-Freezing"><a href="#Reliable-User-Guide-to-Fix-Infinix-Hot-40-Pro-Running-Slow-and-Freezing" class="headerlink" title="Reliable User Guide to Fix Infinix Hot 40 Pro Running Slow and Freezing"></a>Reliable User Guide to Fix Infinix Hot 40 Pro Running Slow and Freezing</h2><p>Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Infinix Hot 40 Pro contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Infinix Hot 40 Pro device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Infinix-Hot-40-Pro-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Infinix-Hot-40-Pro-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Infinix Hot 40 Pro is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Infinix Hot 40 Pro is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Infinix Hot 40 Pro is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Infinix Hot 40 Pros.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Infinix Hot 40 Pro is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone.

How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone</h2><p>How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G device and halt it before the Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G device disables itself.</p><p>Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:</strong> Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer’s warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.</li><li>**Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system’s built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.</li><li>**Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.</li><li><strong>Backup your phone data regularly:</strong> Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.</li><li><strong>Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:</strong> Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is certainly upsetting when your gadget bricks, but you may attempt the solutions listed above to resolve the issue.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Change-Location-on-Yik-Yak-For-your-Vivo-Y100i-Power-5G-to-Enjoy-More-Fun"><a href="#Change-Location-on-Yik-Yak-For-your-Vivo-Y100i-Power-5G-to-Enjoy-More-Fun" class="headerlink" title="Change Location on Yik Yak For your Vivo Y100i Power 5G to Enjoy More Fun"></a>Change Location on Yik Yak For your Vivo Y100i Power 5G to Enjoy More Fun</h2><p>Yik Yak has to be one of the most controversial social media applications. First launched in 2013, Yik Yak went into haze in 2017 after receiving harsh criticism due to its poor privacy policies. However, after four years of complete shutdown, Yik Yak was relaunched in 2021 with improved security features and functionality.</p><p>Ever since its relaunch in August last year, many users on Yik Yak have been looking for ways to change their location to meet people in other cities&#x2F;states. So keep reading if you’ve been trying to find solutions to swap locations in Yik Yak. In today’s guide, we will share the best ways to <strong>change the Yik Yak location</strong> and connect with people from different corners of the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-you-should-know-about-Yik-Yak"><a href="#Part-1-What-you-should-know-about-Yik-Yak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak"></a>Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak</h2><p>If you are not familiar with Yik Yak, here’s what you need to know. Yik Yak is a one-of-a-kind social media platform designed to help users connect with people through text-based posts. In addition, users can anonymously post content and interact with other users in the same location.</p><p>Yik Yak also has a dedicated “Peek” feature that allows users to explore what people are talking about a particular topic in different locations. Even though Yik Yak has limited features compared to other social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Yik Yak still has its fair share of a fan base. People love Yik Yak for its anonymity and enjoy meeting new like-minded people.</p><p>Now, users look for ways to change location on Yik Yak to meet people from different areas. By default, users can only see posts from their current location, and after a while, their feed starts to look pretty repetitive. But, by changing their places, they can expand their radar and find new posts from the desired locations.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-On-Yik-Yak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-On-Yik-Yak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak</h2><p>So, what are the different ways to change location on Yik Yak? Since Yik Yak uses your phone’s GPS sensors to detect the current location, you’ll have to manipulate the GPS signals to get the job done. To do this, you can use different methods such as:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-peek-feature-to-view-other-local-Yik-Yak-groups-or-communities"><a href="#1-Using-the-peek-feature-to-view-other-local-Yik-Yak-groups-or-communities" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities"></a>1. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, Peek is the built-in feature of Yik Yak that allows users to find out what people are saying about a particular topic in different locations.</p><p>However, this feature has a few limitations. First, even though you’ll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won’t be able to react to them. A user can only respond to posts in his particular area. So, “Peek” would only be a suitable solution for exploring posts from other locations, but not changing the Yik Yak location itself.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-to-fake-GPS-location"><a href="#2-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-to-fake-GPS-location" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to fake GPS location"></a>2. Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to fake GPS location</h3><p>If you are looking for an effective way to change your location in Yik Yak, we recommend using a professional GPS simulator like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It’s a cross-platform geo spoofing tool with a built-in teleport mode. With the “Teleport Mode” feature, you’ll be able to change your location to anywhere in the world with a single click.</p><p>It means you’ll be able to publish your own Yik Yak posts from different locations and react to someone else’s posts without interruptions. Apart from Yik Yak, you can also use a tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to manipulate GPS signals in other location-based apps like Pokemon Go or Tinder. It’s a great way to meet people from other cities on dating apps, as any geo-restrictions won’t bind you.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport your current location to anywhere in the world with a single click.</li><li>Fake location on dating and social apps to meet more friends.</li><li>Spoof location on location tracking apps to protect your privacy.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>So, here’s the step-by-step process for changing location on Yik Yak using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install and launch Dr.Fone - Virtual Location on your computer.

Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn’t. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.</p><p>The in-built apps like ‘Camera’ use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg"                      alt="photo with date stamp"                ></p><p>Your ‘Reminder or Alarm’ apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you’ve reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg"                      alt="reminder app"                ></p><p>The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location apps"                ></p><p>Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in. You want to know the true south, enable your location, sync with the Compass app, and you’ll have the answers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/compass-app-pic5.jpg"                      alt="compass app"                ></p><p>So, to sum that up, the Location Settings will determine which app gets to access your location and which does not. Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it’s okay to share the Location. If you accept, that’s how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS. When you spoof iPhone Location, then these apps will register this fake location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-a-PC-program"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-a-PC-program" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS location on iPhone using a PC program"></a>Part 2: Change GPS location on iPhone using a PC program</h2><p>The GPS Spoofing iPhone is very easy, especially when you go for a quick PC Program.

How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)</h2><p>If you have already tried running the Xiaomi Civi 3 device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Xiaomi Civi 3’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.</p><h3 id="Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Restart Your Device"></a>Restart Your Device</h3><p>When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Hold the “Power” button until the Xiaomi Civi 3 device turns off.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG"                      alt="restart android with power button"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> When the Xiaomi Civi 3 device turns off, wait a few seconds.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Xiaomi Civi 3 device.</p><p>Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.</p><h3 id="Turn-On-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Turn-On-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Turn On Safe Mode"></a>Turn On Safe Mode</h3><p>You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.</p><p>If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> To force a restart, press and hold the Xiaomi Civi 3 device’s “Power” button for an extended period.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> When you let go of the “Power” button, press and hold the “Volume Down” button. After that, a “Safe Mode” label will appear in your screen’s lower-left corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-2.JPG"                      alt="turn-on-safe-mode-android"                ></p><h3 id="Turn-Off-Developer-Options"><a href="#Turn-Off-Developer-Options" class="headerlink" title="Turn Off Developer Options"></a>Turn Off Developer Options</h3><p>Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.</p><p>If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Launch the <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select the <strong><strong>System</strong></strong> menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Advanced options menu, then select Developer Options.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> You will then find the switch to turn it on or off. Disable itby toggling the button off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-3.PNG"                      alt="turn off developer options in android"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 5:</strong></strong> Restart your device to check if the part of the touch screen not working issue has been resolved.</p><h3 id="Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings"><a href="#Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Device to Factory Settings"></a>Reset Device to Factory Settings</h3><p>Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Go to <strong>Find My Device</strong> from any d<strong><strong>evice</strong></strong> and sign in to the Google account associated with the damaged screen device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> After successfully logging in, you will see your device’s name.

It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Lava Blaze 2 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version.

Sometimes, it’s even more frustrating than a physically broken screen because you don’t know where the issue is coming from.</p><p>If your <strong>touchscreen is malfunctioning</strong> or doesn’t work correctly, you cannot interact with your device. On this page, you’ll learn general <strong>phone touch problems</strong> on Android and how to get rid of them. Now explore the article to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg"                      alt="android screen problems intro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-My-Android-Experiencing-Touch-Screen-Problems"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-My-Android-Experiencing-Touch-Screen-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems"></a>Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems</h2><p>Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.</p><ul><li>The <strong>touchscreen problem</strong>freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.</li><li>Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.</li><li>Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).</li><li>The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.</li><li>It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.</li><li>The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.</li><li>Outdated devices are prone to the black&#x2F;white&#x2F;blue screen of death.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Tips-Fixes-and-Workarounds-To-Fix-Your-Vivo-G2-Touch-Problems"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-Fixes-and-Workarounds-To-Fix-Your-Vivo-G2-Touch-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Vivo G2 Touch Problems"></a>Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Vivo G2 Touch Problems</h2><p>If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your <strong>touch screen malfunctioning,</strong> here are some solutions to fix it.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Remove-the-Screen-Protector-and-Phone-Case"><a href="#Method-1-Remove-the-Screen-Protector-and-Phone-Case" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case"></a>Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case</h3><p>Some phone cases and screen protectors cause <strong>touch problems</strong> on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a <strong>touchscreen problem</strong> on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg"                      alt="android restart method"                ></p><p>To restart your Android, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the <strong>Power</strong> button as well as the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button at the same time.</p><h3 id="Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android"></a>Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android</h3><p>Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Backup and Reset.</strong> Next, tap on <strong>Factory data reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete all</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg"                      alt="android factory data reset"                ></p><p>Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode"></a>Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode</h3><p>If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Placing your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Vivo G2.</p><p><strong>Step 1A</strong>: Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button and <strong>Volume Down</strong> buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1B</strong>: If your Vivo G2 still has a <strong>Home</strong> button, press and hold the <strong>Home</strong> button and the <strong>Power</strong> button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1C</strong>: If step 1A did not put your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the <strong>Volume</strong> buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset, and confirm your choice with the <strong>Power</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 02"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for the process to complete and for your Vivo G2 to restart automatically.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen"><a href="#Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen"></a>Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen</h3><p>If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the <strong>touchscreen problem,</strong> it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Vivo G2 checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg"                      alt="图像"                >“</p><h3 id="Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center"><a href="#Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center" class="headerlink" title="Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center"></a>Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center</h3><p>Your <strong>phone touch problem</strong> might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Fix-Android-Touch-Problem-With-an-Alternative"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Fix-Android-Touch-Problem-With-an-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Fix Android Touch Problem With an Alternative"></a>Part 3: How To Fix Android Touch Problem With an Alternative</h2><p>If all the general <strong>phone touch problems</strong> on your Vivo G2 persist, you should strongly consider <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-repair/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> to do the job.

Here’s how you can boot your Vivo Y17s into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Power Off Your Device</strong></p><p>Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Safe Mode</strong></p><p>To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:</p><ul><li>For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer’s logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Vivo Y17s device finishes booting. You should see “Safe Mode” displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.</li><li>Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Vivo Y17s device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Vivo Y17s.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Honor X9a. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Honor X9a or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Honor X9a&#x2F;Redmi phone</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi recovery mode operation"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.</p><h3 id="Factory-Reset"><a href="#Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Factory Reset"></a>Factory Reset</h3><p>If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your <strong>phone being stuck on the startup screen</strong> through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.</p><p>Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1</strong></strong>: Open the <strong>Settings</strong> application on your phone and <strong>tap General Management</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="general management on samsung"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2</strong></strong>: Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Factory data reset.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>: Swipe to and tap <strong>Reset</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="Honor X9a reset button"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before carrying out a factory reset, you need to input the password of your Honor X9a Account.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Phone-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Phone Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>If all the solutions above do not work and you do not want to perform a factory reset on your phone, one option is to use an application called <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

Then follow the steps given below:</p><p>Step 1: Launch the application and choose the System Repair option from the main interface. Connect your Honor X9a to the computer and choose the Android Repair mode, and hit the Start button to begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="fix android not receiving texts with Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will have to provide information about your device, including the brand, name, model, country, and carrier. In between, you will be notified that your device repair might erase the existing data of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-2.png"                      alt="android not receiving texts - provide info"                ></p><p>Step 3: Agree with the conditions and hit the Next button. The software will download the firmware package automatically. It might take a while to finish the download, and when it is finished, the repair process will be initiated automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-8.png"                      alt="android not receiving texts - download firmware"                ></p><p>It won’t take long, and your Honor X9a will be repaired. Now you will be able to receive and send text messages without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-and-Insert-the-SIM" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM"></a>Part 2: Remove and Insert the SIM</h2><p>The easiest thing that you can try if your Honor X9a is not receiving any text messages is because the SIM is not inserted right. If your SIM card is inserted wrong, then it is obvious you can’t receive text messages on Android. Simply take out the SIM card, see how it must be inserted, and do it correctly. Once the SIM is inserted in the right way, you will receive the pending text messages immediately unless there is another issue preventing it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Part-3-Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Check Network Connection"></a>Part 3: Check Network Connection</h2><p>Another simple method that you can try if you are not receiving text messages on Honor X9a phone is to check your network connection. Usually, you can see the bar on the top of the screen. Maybe the problem exists because you have no signal strength at the moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/no-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check connection"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan"><a href="#Part-4-Consult-your-Carrier-about-the-Data-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan"></a>Part 4: Consult your Carrier about the Data Plan</h2><p>Maybe you are unable to get messages on your Honor X9as because your existing data plan has expired. You can directly contact your Carrier about the issues where your Honor X9a is not receiving texts. If your plan has expired, then you might have to renew it immediately. If not, then try out other fixes to resolve this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot"><a href="#Part-5-Try-the-SIM-card-in-Another-Phone-or-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot"></a>Part 5: Try the SIM card in Another Phone or Slot</h2><p>Sometimes, people complain that Honor X9a is not receiving texts from iPhone, and it might be because of the SIM card issue. So, the best thing you can try is to remove the SIM from your current phone and insert it into another phone.</p><p>When you are offline the message is saved on the server and just about when you get online, the text messages are delivered. If it is the SIM issue, then you will not get the message unless you contact your network operator.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-6-Clear-the-Cache-of-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App"></a>Part 6: Clear the Cache of Messaging App</h2><p>In smartphones, the memory space often gets filled up with cache. And not everyone remembers that they have to clear the cache from time to time. The accumulated cache can also lead to this issue. So, if your Android messaging app is not working, you have to clear the cache memory.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings and go to Apps. Find the Messages app from the list and tap to open it. There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Honor X9a device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Honor X9a, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both. The phone messages can be deleted directly from your phone. But the SIM card messages needed to be deleted separately. The SIM cards don’t have enough memory to hold plenty of messages. Therefore, once the storage is full, you will stop receiving messages entirely.</p><p>Step 1: Open the messages app and open settings. Look for an option that says “Manage SIM Card Messages”. Sometimes, you can find this option under Advanced Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/manage-SIM-card-messages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - free up space"                ></p><p>Step 2: There, you will see the existing messages on the SIM. You can either delete all the messages or perform a selective deletion to free up space.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App"><a href="#Part-8-Try-a-Third-party-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App"></a>Part 8: Try a Third-party Messaging App</h2><p>If you can’t receive messages on your default app, then you can try installing a third-party messaging app. Nowadays, most people use social media messaging apps like WhatsApp, Skype, etc. for messaging. So, if somehow, the Android is not receiving texts, then the new apps can help you to send and receive messages with a non-native network.</p><p><em>Further Reading: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/topsoftware/best-free-chat-apps.html" >15 Best Free Chat Apps in 2022.

Sometimes, when the Android is in power saving mode, it disables the default apps too. As a result, you can’t even receive text messages on Android. So, when you plug in the charger, the power saving mode will be disabled, and you will get your text messages.</p><h2 id="Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone"><a href="#Part-10-Ensure-It’s-Not-An-iMessage-From-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone"></a>Part 10: Ensure It’s Not An iMessage From iPhone</h2><p>If the Honor X9a phone is not receiving texts from iPhone, then this might be a different issue. Usually, there is an option on the iPhone where they can send texts as iMessage and simple messages. If the iPhone user sends the text as iMessage, then it will not show up on the Android device. To resolve this, you have to follow the steps below:</p><p>Taking the iPhone in hand makes sure that you are connected to a network. Open settings and scroll to look for the Message option. Toggle the bar next to the iMessage option to turn it off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/deactivate-imessages.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts - check iphone message"                ></p><p>If the FaceTime option is also on, you might have to deactivate that too to send messages and calls as regular ones.</p><h2 id="Part-11-Update-Your-Android"><a href="#Part-11-Update-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 11: Update Your Android"></a>Part 11: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-update/samsung-update.html" >Update Your Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Updating the operating system to the latest Android version can fix some system errors which may cause the “Android not receiving texts” issue because the latest version always brings a better user experience and fix the know bugs.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Now you know several methods that can work if the Android messaging app is not working.  If you experience this kind of issue with your Honor X9a, then you are most likely to resolve them with these fixes.

This might be the reason why the contact app crashes rapidly on your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5. Hence, it can prove to be a good remedy for this problem.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-use-Snapchat-Location-Spoofer-to-Protect-Your-Privacy-On-Oppo-Reno-8T"><a href="#How-to-use-Snapchat-Location-Spoofer-to-Protect-Your-Privacy-On-Oppo-Reno-8T" class="headerlink" title="How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Oppo Reno 8T?"></a>How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Oppo Reno 8T?</h2><p>People are very happy about Snapchat’s new Snap map feature. It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg"                      alt="find bitmoji"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on&#x2F;off.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg" alt="tap location on/off"></p><p><strong>iPhone</strong></p><p>To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg"                      alt="go to setting on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg"                      alt="tap privacy option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg"                      alt="click location services option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now connect Your Oppo Reno 8T to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="set the location"                ></p><p>One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg"                      alt="signup for quick connect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg"                      alt="choose the server"                ></p><p>So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions"></a><strong>Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><strong>Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone.

It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat-1"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg"                      alt="find bitmoji"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on&#x2F;off.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg" alt="tap location on/off"></p><p><strong>iPhone</strong></p><p>To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg"                      alt="go to setting on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg"                      alt="tap privacy option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg"                      alt="click location services option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location.

Go for ‘Virtual Location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now connect Your Oppo Reno 8T to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="set the location"                ></p><p>One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg"                      alt="signup for quick connect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg"                      alt="choose the server"                ></p><p>So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions-1"><a href="#Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions"></a><strong>Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><strong>Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion-1"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-realme-c67-4g-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked Realme C67 4G Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-tecno-spark-20-pro-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Tecno Spark 20 Pro Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-unbrick-a-dead-poco-m6-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Unbrick a Dead Poco M6 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-honor-x50-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Honor X50 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-itel-a05s-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Itel A05s Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/solved-warning-camera-failed-on-tecno-spark-10-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Solved Warning Camera Failed on Tecno Spark 10 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-a-bricked-oneplus-ace-2-back-to-operation-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Restore a Bricked OnePlus Ace 2 Back to Operation | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reasons-for-lava-blaze-2-pro-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Lava Blaze 2 Pro Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-motorola-defy-2-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Motorola Defy 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-lava-yuva-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Lava Yuva 2 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-on-motorola-moto-g84-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working on Motorola Moto G84 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-tecno-spark-go-2023-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Tecno Spark Go (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/sony-xperia-5-v-stuck-on-screen-finding-solutions-for-stuck-on-boot-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Sony Xperia 5 V Stuck on Screen – Finding Solutions For Stuck on Boot | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-infinix-hot-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Infinix Hot 30 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-the-Soft-Bricked-Motorola-Defy-2"><a href="#How-to-Fix-the-Soft-Bricked-Motorola-Defy-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix the Soft Bricked Motorola Defy 2?"></a>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Motorola Defy 2?</h2><p>Bricked phone is a serious problem, as your brick smartphone could be suffering from a soft brick or hard brick problem, and must be dealt with carefully. It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.</p><p>A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home&#x2F;main screen of the Motorola Defy 2 device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Motorola Defy 2 device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Motorola Defy 2 device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn’t respond to any command, even the power on command.</p><p>If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.</p><p>Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?"></a>Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?</h2><p>To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.</p><p>A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error&#x2F;crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg" alt="hard bricked v/s soft bricked "></p><p>Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone. The techniques listed here are the best and the most efficient ways to get your phone back to its normal working conditions without losing your important data or damaging your device or its software.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop"></a>Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop</h2><p>This is the first sign of a soft bricked Android phone. Boot Loop is nothing but when your phone does not remain switched off and turns itself on automatically, and freezes at the logo screen or blank screen, every time you manually try to power it off.</p><p>Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reasons-for-Xiaomi-13T-Stuck-on-Startup-Screen-and-Ways-To-Fix-Them"><a href="#Reasons-for-Xiaomi-13T-Stuck-on-Startup-Screen-and-Ways-To-Fix-Them" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Xiaomi 13T Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them"></a>Reasons for Xiaomi 13T Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them</h2><p>There are many reasons why <strong><strong>phones get stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. It could be something as simple as physical damage or more complicated related to software problems. Having your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen, or boot screen is annoying, and it is no surprise that people will find ways to fix this issue when encountered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="samsung stuck on boot screen"                ></p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><p>It is not uncommon for <strong>phones</strong> to be <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page.</p><p>Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Xiaomi 13T. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="hard reboot of samsung"                ></p><h3 id="Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#Put-your-phone-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your phone in recovery mode"></a>Put your phone in recovery mode</h3><p>If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode.

When your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong>, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.</p><p>Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.</p><ol start="2"><li>How do you fix a boot loop?</li></ol><p>When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.</p><p>For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><strong>3,405,439</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article summarizes some of the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.

In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-Xiaomi-13T"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Xiaomi-13T" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your Xiaomi 13T"></a>2. Restart Your Xiaomi 13T</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer.

Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.</p><p>You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network.
