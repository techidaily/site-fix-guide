Fix It Now"></a>Motorola G54 5G Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now</h2><p>For all its glory and goodness, the Android OS often has its users pulling their hair in frustration at just how buggy the OS can be at times. So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today. People only launch the app when they want to take a photo, for everything else there’s a dedicated photo gallery app. What happens when you launch the camera app only to realize it threw an error and you missed your photo moment? Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="camera not working error in android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Android-Camera-Not-Working" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?"></a>Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Motorola G54 5G.</p><p><strong>Low Memory</strong></p><p>Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.</p><p><strong>Low Storage</strong></p><p>The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Motorola G54 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Motorola G54 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Motorola G54 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Motorola G54 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS.

An “Application not installed” error message usually pops up when you are trying to download and install an App with a .apk file extension from somewhere other than the Google Play Store. The error is very confusing at first but makes sense when you realize that this unknown Error Code during Application installation is neither a software issue nor a hardware problem. It is a direct outcome of what you do with your device. Yes, you heard that right. Your faulty actions can cause Android App not installed error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/app-not-installed-error-in-android.jpg"                      alt="app not install on android"                ></p><p>What to do when trying to install the Android APK it says “app not installed”? It is terrible that you can’t install App on your device. But in this article, you will know more about the causes behind this error and the best ways to fix it, read on, here is all you need to know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error"><a href="#Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error"></a>Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error</h2><p>You may ask: Why can’t I download apps on my Motorola G54 5G? Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Motorola G54 5G device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Motorola G54 5G device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Motorola G54 5G or tablet?

Though, this should be your last resort, as it will wipe off your device’s data entirely. Even if you are performing a factory reset, make sure that you back up your data by using a reliable tool like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Wondershare Dr.Fone</h3><p>Flexibly Back up and Restore Android Data</p><ul><li>Back up Android data to the computer with one click.</li><li>Preview and restore selectively the backup to any Android device.</li><li>Supports 8000+ Android devices.</li><li>There is no data lost during backup, export, or restoration.</li></ul><p><strong>3,981,454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>If your phone is functioning, then you can easily factory reset it by visiting Settings &gt; General &gt; Backup &amp; Restore and selecting the option of “Factory Data Reset”.

Therefore, if you also have a rooted Android device, then you can choose to unroot it in order to fix this issue. There are different ways to unroot an Android device. One of the easiest ways to do it is by using the SuperSU app.</p><p>You can always download either SuperSU or SuperSU Pro app from its website <a class="link"   href="https://supersuroot.org/" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Simply install it on our device and launch it whenever you wish to unroot it. Visit its “Settings” tab and select the option of “Full unroot”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671048148.jpg"                      alt="full unroot"                ></p><p>This will generate a warning message regarding all the repercussions of the unrooting process. Just tap on “Continue” to initiate the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671247132.jpg"                      alt="continue unroot"                ></p><p>If you are using an older version of Android, then you might get another pop-up to restore boot images. Simply make the desired selection and start the process. After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671431228.jpg"                      alt="restore stock boot image"                ></p><p>Now that you know different ways to fix the <strong>process system not responding</strong> error, you can easily overcome this issue and make the most out of your device. Simply start with the easy fixes, and if they don’t work, then take extreme measures like unrooting your device or restoring it to factory setting. Also, make sure to back up your data before taking any extreme measures.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

Whenever you cannot access the content of your choice or when you want to play some games, they must have asked you to change your location or spoof it. Creating a fake location iOS will not just help you with games and content, but also hide your identity and keep stalkers away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-change-iphone-pic1.jpg"                      alt="location change in iphone"                ></p><p>The changed location will reflect in all of your social media databases and other everyday apps. No one can track you down using the over-smart softwares that pry on user locations on different apps they use. By doing so, you are enhancing your online security, protecting your privacy, and, in some cases, also keeping your personal information a secret. Trust us when we say that certain apps need your information worth plenty of bucks but get away with procuring it without your permission.</p><p>There is no harm in changing your GPS location, especially when the world wide web is eager to monetize your information. A proper iOS Fake GPS will keep you safe virtually. Then you might wonder, - How do I use apps to navigate the roads or track down that pub in the locality? Well, you can always revert to your original location whenever you want to just that these tricks will help you stay in the safe bubble most of the time.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-iPhone-Location-Settings-for"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-iPhone-Location-Settings-for" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is iPhone Location Settings for?"></a>Part 1: What is iPhone Location Settings for?</h2><p>The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn’t. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.</p><p>The in-built apps like ‘Camera’ use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg"                      alt="photo with date stamp"                ></p><p>Your ‘Reminder or Alarm’ apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you’ve reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg"                      alt="reminder app"                ></p><p>The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location apps"                ></p><p>Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in. You want to know the true south, enable your location, sync with the Compass app, and you’ll have the answers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/compass-app-pic5.jpg"                      alt="compass app"                ></p><p>So, to sum that up, the Location Settings will determine which app gets to access your location and which does not. Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it’s okay to share the Location. If you accept, that’s how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS. When you spoof iPhone Location, then these apps will register this fake location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-a-PC-program"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-a-PC-program" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS location on iPhone using a PC program"></a>Part 2: Change GPS location on iPhone using a PC program</h2><p>The GPS Spoofing iPhone is very easy, especially when you go for a quick PC Program. These are easily available and do a better job than VPNs. There is no data logging, so your security and privacy are not at risk.</p><p>Wondershare’s Dr. Fone is one of the best applications if you are looking for a PC Program. It is going to get your work done in just four steps. This is what you should be doing -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You have to download the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is easily available for everyone. Launch the application, and the options will display on your screen. Choose the ‘Virtual Location’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone homepage"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect your phone to your computer and click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A Map displaying the entire world will appear on your screen. On the top right corner, the third icon represents the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then click on ‘Move Here’ when you are completely sure that this is the place you want to be in ‘Virtually’. The map makes the shift for you, and the same will mirror in your Tecno Spark 20C too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>This is the simplest way to change iPhone Location without Jailbreak. We will discover some other methods in the following Parts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-an-external-device"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-an-external-device" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS location on iPhone using an external device"></a>Part 3: Change GPS location on iPhone using an external device</h2><p>The external devices connect to the Lightning port of your device and create a secondary GPS that your apps and iPhone will detect. These are not completely software-based. You need to buy these mini-devices first, and then you can proceed with the location spoofing. These areas reliable as any softwares and much more than VPNs.</p><p>One of the best devices that we can suggest is Double Location.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Buy the Double Location device and install the companion iOS app that is needed to change&#x2F; alter the location of your device. Then connect Double Location Dongle to your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic10.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Keep in mind - The iOS companion apps are not available on the App Store, and you need to download them from their websites. The installation and launch procedure will differ depending upon the iOS model you are using. You have to follow the Double Location Manufacturer’s guidelines keenly not to jailbreak your phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open the Double Location iOS app and open the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic11.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Move the pin to the location that you want to shift to virtually. If you cannot pinpoint the exact location, there is nothing much we can do about it. You have to settle for a little compromise. Adjust any other settings that you want to (Gaming).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic12.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On the bottom of the screen, hit the lock position option, and your iOS Spoof Location will reflect everywhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic13.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-Xcode"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-Xcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on iPhone using Xcode"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on iPhone using Xcode</h2><p>XCode is a computer program.

To check the mobile data on your Tecno Spark 20C, you need to go to <strong>Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Mobile Data</strong>. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user’s average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.</p><h4 id="3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera"><a href="#3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3.

Have Access to Your Device’s Microphone or Camera</h4><p>When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Tecno Spark 20C’s camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.</p><h4 id="4-Increased-Device-Shut-Down-Time"><a href="#4-Increased-Device-Shut-Down-Time" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-the-Soft-Bricked-Xiaomi-Civi-3-Disney-100th-Anniversary-Edition"><a href="#How-to-Fix-the-Soft-Bricked-Xiaomi-Civi-3-Disney-100th-Anniversary-Edition" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix the Soft Bricked Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition?"></a>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition?</h2><p>Bricked phone is a serious problem, as your brick smartphone could be suffering from a soft brick or hard brick problem, and must be dealt with carefully. It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.</p><p>A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home&#x2F;main screen of the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn’t respond to any command, even the power on command.</p><p>If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.</p><p>Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?"></a>Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?</h2><p>To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.</p><p>A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error&#x2F;crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg" alt="hard bricked v/s soft bricked"></p><p>Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone. The techniques listed here are the best and the most efficient ways to get your phone back to its normal working conditions without losing your important data or damaging your device or its software.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop"></a>Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop</h2><p>This is the first sign of a soft bricked Android phone. Boot Loop is nothing but when your phone does not remain switched off and turns itself on automatically, and freezes at the logo screen or blank screen, every time you manually try to power it off.</p><p>Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions. These partitions are nothing but storage locations for your modem, kernels, system files, drivers and built-in Apps data.</p><p>It is advisable to clear Cache partitions regularly to keep your phone free from such glitches.</p><p>Since the phone refuses to boot, Cache can be cleared from entering into the Recovery Mode. Different Android devices have different ways to put it in recovery mode. Normally pressing the power key and volume down key helps, but you may refer to your phone’s guide for better understanding and then follow the steps given below to clear the cache partition:</p><p>Once you are the recovery mode screen, you will see a number of options as shown in the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987490613783.jpg"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p>Use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987491246838.jpg"                      alt="”Wipe cache partition”"                >&gt;</p><p>After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged up and unwanted files. You may loose some App related data, but that is a small price to pay to fix your bricked phone.</p><p>If this method does not boot up your brick smartphone and the problem still persists, there are two more things you can try. Read ahead to find out about them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode"><a href="#Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode"></a>Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode</h2><p>If your bricked phone does not boot up to your Home Screen or Lock screen and instead boots directly into Recovery Mode, there is not much left to do. Booting straight into recovery mode is undoubtedly a soft brick error but it also indicates a possible problem with your current ROM. The only option you have to flash a new ROM to reboot your bricked phone back to its normal functioning.</p><p>To flash a new ROM:</p><p>Firstly, you must root your phone and unlock the Bootloader. Every phone’s mechanism to unlock the bootloader is different, thus, we suggest to refer to your user manual.</p><p>Once the Bootloader is unlocked, take a backup of all your data by selecting “Backup” or “Android” back in recovery mode. The process should not take long and all you need to do is tap “OK” to config backup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191436732.jpg"                      alt="backup and restore"                ></p><p>In this step, download a ROM of your choice and store it in your SD Card. Insert the SD Card in your phone to begin the flashing process.</p><p>Once at the recovery mode, select “Install Zip from SD Card” from the options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191676749.jpg"                      alt="install zip from sdcard"                ></p><p>Scroll down using the volume key and use the power key to select the downloaded ROM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191926694.jpg"                      alt="Scroll down"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987192218478.jpg"                      alt="select the downloaded ROM"                ></p><p>This might take a few minutes of your time, but once the process is complete, reboot your phone.</p><p>Hopefully, your bricked phone will not boot normally and work smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader"><a href="#Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader"></a>Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader</h2><p>If your bricked phone boots straight into Bootloader, then this a serious issue and must not be taken lightly. Flashing a new ROM or clearing cache partitions are of little help in such a brick smartphone situation. Booting straight into Bootloader is a peculiar soft bricked Android phone feature and can be tackled only by downloading and flashing your original ROM from the manufacturer. In order to do so, a detailed study about your manufacturer’s ROM, ways to download and flash must be carried out. Since different Android phones come with different types of ROMs, it difficult to cover all the aspects about the different types of ROMs.</p><p>Brick smartphone problem has become more prominent than phone freezing or hanging issue. Android users are often seen looking for solutions to fix their soft brick and hard brick phones. Android phones are prone to get bricked and thus, it is important for us to know about the three techniques given above. These methods have been tried, tested and recommended by ay affected bricked phone users. Therefore, these tips are reliable and worth a try. So if your phone acts stubborn and refuses to boot normally, examine the problem carefully and adopt one of the solutions given above which best suits your situation.</p><h2 id="Spotify-Keeps-Crashing-A-Complete-List-of-Fixes-You-Can-Use-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3-Disney-100th-Anniversary-Edition"><a href="#Spotify-Keeps-Crashing-A-Complete-List-of-Fixes-You-Can-Use-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3-Disney-100th-Anniversary-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Keeps Crashing: A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition"></a>Spotify Keeps Crashing: A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-1.jpg"                      alt="spotify logo"                ></p><p>Does your <strong>Spotify keep crashing</strong>?

The steps may vary slightly depending on the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.

Set up your time and date with these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>on your Android.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong>or <strong>General Management</strong> (depending on your Android model).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to <strong>Date and Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Set Date</strong>and set the correct date.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-9.jpg"                      alt="set date on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to <strong>Set Time</strong>and set the right time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg"                      alt="set time on android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Your-System-Software"><a href="#6-Update-Your-System-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Your System Software"></a>6. Update Your System Software</h3><p>Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated.

Here’s How to Fix It"></a>OnePlus Nord 3 5G Screen Unresponsive? Here’s How to Fix It</h2><p>OnePlus Nord 3 5G phones have become increasingly popular due to their advanced features, sleek designs, and affordable prices. These phones offer many benefits, including high-quality cameras, long battery life, and fast processing speeds. However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a <strong>OnePlus Nord 3 5G touch screen not working</strong>, which can be frustrating and difficult.</p><p>This article aims to provide solutions for OnePlus Nord 3 5G phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>OnePlus Nord 3 5G touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A OnePlus Nord 3 5G Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A OnePlus Nord 3 5G Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a OnePlus Nord 3 5G phone’s screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of OnePlus Nord 3 5G screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some OnePlus Nord 3 5G Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause OnePlus Nord 3 5G screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any OnePlus Nord 3 5G model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, OnePlus Nord 3 5G Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><h2 id="The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-OnePlus-Nord-3-5G-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="The Common Solutions To Solve A OnePlus Nord 3 5G Screen Unresponsive"></a>The Common Solutions To Solve A OnePlus Nord 3 5G Screen Unresponsive</h2><p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of OnePlus Nord 3 5G screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the OnePlus Nord 3 5G model.</p><h3 id="1-Restart-The-Device"><a href="#1-Restart-The-Device" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart The Device"></a>1. Restart The Device</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mui restart button"                ></p><p>Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the OnePlus Nord 3 5G black screen problem. It’s a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone’s memory.</p><p>It is the most commonly used method to fix OnePlus Nord 3 5G’s touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a OnePlus Nord 3 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the OnePlus Nord 3 5Glogo appears.</p><h3 id="2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely"><a href="#2-Leave-The-Phone-And-Let-The-Battery-Drain-Completely" class="headerlink" title="2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely"></a>2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg"                      alt="low battery"                ></p><p>Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device from functioning correctly. Leaving the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.</p><h3 id="3-Contact-Custom-Service"><a href="#3-Contact-Custom-Service" class="headerlink" title="3. Contact Custom Service"></a>3. Contact Custom Service</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg"                      alt="xiaomi contact customer service"                ></p><p>If restarting the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn’t resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device in for repair or replacement. It’s important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.</p><p>In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on OnePlus Nord 3 5G Y2 and OnePlus Nord 3 5G 5A.</p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Device-Performance"><a href="#4-Optimize-Device-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Device Performance"></a>4. Optimize Device Performance</h3><p>One solution is to optimize the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.</p><p>You can clear your cached data using the default settings.</p><ul><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Cached Data</strong>.</li><li>To clear the cache, select <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png"                      alt="clear cached data on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Back-Up-And-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Back Up And Factory Reset"></a>5. Back Up And Factory Reset</h3><p>Another solution is to back up the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone’s settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device, so it should only be considered a last resort.</p><p>In the following steps, we will show you how to format the OnePlus Nord 3 5G Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.</p><ul><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the A<strong>dditional settings</strong> section of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G Redmi 5A settings.</li><li>Please scroll down the screen until you reach the <strong>Backup &amp; reset</strong> option, then click to access it.</li><li>Click<strong>Erase all data (factory reset)</strong> to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the OnePlus Nord 3 5G Redmi 5A.</li><li>Select <strong>All files on the phone</strong>to make a complete format of the OnePlus Nord 3 5G Redmi 5A.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/factory-reset-on-xiaomi5a-1.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on xiaomi 5a"                ></p><h3 id="6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair"><a href="#6-Using-Dr-Fone-Repair" class="headerlink" title="6. Using Dr. Fone Repair"></a>6. Using Dr. Fone Repair</h3><p>If none of the above solutions worked, you can try using Dr. Fone Repair.

It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone.

As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your OnePlus Nord 3 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version.

Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging.

The steps may vary slightly depending on the OnePlus Nord 3 5G device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-8.jpg"                      alt="restart android to fix spotify crashing"                ></p><h3 id="5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date"><a href="#5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date" class="headerlink" title="5. Set Up Your Time and Date"></a>5. Set Up Your Time and Date</h3><p>Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>on your Android.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong>or <strong>General Management</strong> (depending on your Android model).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to <strong>Date and Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Set Date</strong>and set the correct date.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-9.jpg"                      alt="set date on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to <strong>Set Time</strong>and set the right time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg"                      alt="set time on android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Your-System-Software"><a href="#6-Update-Your-System-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Your System Software"></a>6. Update Your System Software</h3><p>Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reliable-User-Guide-to-Fix-Oppo-Find-X6-Running-Slow-and-Freezing"><a href="#Reliable-User-Guide-to-Fix-Oppo-Find-X6-Running-Slow-and-Freezing" class="headerlink" title="Reliable User Guide to Fix Oppo Find X6 Running Slow and Freezing"></a>Reliable User Guide to Fix Oppo Find X6 Running Slow and Freezing</h2><p>Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Oppo Find X6 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Oppo Find X6 device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Oppo Find X6 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Oppo Find X6 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Oppo Find X6 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Oppo Find X6 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Oppo-Find-X6-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Oppo-Find-X6-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Oppo Find X6 is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Oppo Find X6 is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Oppo Find X6 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Oppo Find X6s.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Oppo Find X6 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Oppo Find X6 device. So if your Oppo Find X6 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Oppo Find X6 device’s animation type and speed on your Oppo Find X6 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Oppo Find X6 to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Oppo Find X6 is running slow and freezing, the Oppo Find X6 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues"></a>Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues</h3><p>Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Oppo Find X6 device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Oppo Find X6 is running slow and freezing.</p><h3 id="Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable"><a href="#Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable" class="headerlink" title="Your Internet Connection is Unstable"></a>Your Internet Connection is Unstable</h3><p>Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Oppo Find X6 is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-My-Oppo-Find-X6-Lags"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-My-Oppo-Find-X6-Lags" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When My Oppo Find X6 Lags?"></a>What to Do When My Oppo Find X6 Lags?</h2><p>It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow. However, it can still cause some delays and inconvenience for users. So it’s really important to take action when you notice some anomalies with its speed and performance. Below are some remedies that can help you get rid of this issue.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Reboot-Your-Phone"><a href="#Solution-1-Reboot-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Reboot Your Phone"></a>Solution 1: Reboot Your Phone</h3><p>Sometimes, minor bugs can give your device a hard time. It can be the reason why your Oppo Find X6 is running slow and freezing. If that’s the case, rebooting your phone might help a lot. Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> For seven seconds or more, hold the <strong>Power</strong> and the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button together.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-phone-running-slow-and-freezing-1.JPG"                      alt="android phone restarts"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Several options will manifest on the screen.

It’s no surprise that smartphone touchscreens are one of the most common components to fail, given their delicate glass construction. However, a <strong><strong>part of the touch screen not working</strong></strong> on your Vivo Y200 does not necessarily mean it is a hardware issue. There could be other reasons why your Android’s touch screen stopped responding.</p><p>If your phone’s touchscreen frequently fails to respond, there are several things you can try before calling a professional.

Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working"></a>Part 1. Why Is Part of My Screen Not Working</h2><p>There are two possible causes as to why your phone’s touch screen is not working. One is the touch screen may have been damaged, and the other is the Vivo Y200 device may be experiencing technical difficulties.</p><p>If you drop your phone and it becomes stuck against something, the touch screen’s connectivity may fail.

A <strong><strong>part of the touch screen not working</strong></strong> can occur when malware is downloaded or when phone settings are changed.</p><p>Now, the problem can affect any Android phone, and users may encounter the following error messages on their respective phone models:</p><ul><li>Vivo Y200 P40 lite <strong><strong>half touch screen not working</strong></strong></li><li>Nexus touch screen not working</li><li>LG screen is unresponsive to touch</li><li>Vivo Y200 <strong><strong>left side of the screen is not working</strong></strong></li><li>Redmi’s whole screen is unresponsive to touch</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Types-of-Touch-Screen-Issues-and-What-You-Should-Check-Before-Fixing"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Types-of-Touch-Screen-Issues-and-What-You-Should-Check-Before-Fixing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Different Types of Touch Screen Issues and What You Should Check Before Fixing"></a>Part 2. Different Types of Touch Screen Issues and What You Should Check Before Fixing</h2><p>You may experience a variety of touch screens not working on Android issues:</p><ul><li>A certain <strong><strong>part of the touch screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li><li>Your touches do not register on the touch screen.</li><li>The touch screen incorrectly responds to your touch.</li><li><strong><strong>Half touch screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li><li>The touch screen becomes frozen or hangs.</li><li>The screen flashes, flickers, or remains blank.</li><li>The<strong><strong>left side of the phone screen is not working</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p>Before proceeding to how to fix an unresponsive touch screen on an Android device, you should complete the following steps:</p><ul><li>Examine the screen of your device. Check to see if it is cracked or chipped.</li><li>If the screen is damaged, it must be replaced.</li><li>Remove the Vivo Y200 device cover and screen protector if they are not damaged.</li><li>If there is a sticker on the Vivo Y200 device screen, you must remove it.</li><li>Before continuing, make sure your screen is spotless.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Fix-Part-of-the-Touch-Screen-Not-Working-No-Physical-Damage"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Fix-Part-of-the-Touch-Screen-Not-Working-No-Physical-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)"></a>Part 3. How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working (No Physical Damage)</h2><p>If you have already tried running the Vivo Y200 device in diagnostic mode and verified that it is not physically damaged, then the problem is most likely technical. If your Vivo Y200’s screen is not responding to touches for technical reasons, follow the methods below to resolve the issue.</p><h3 id="Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Restart Your Device"></a>Restart Your Device</h3><p>When your touch screen stops working, the first thing you should do is restart your device. The operation is known as soft resetting. You cannot turn your device off from the option on the screen because the touch screen is not responding. Here are the steps to take.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Hold the “Power” button until the Vivo Y200 device turns off.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-1.JPG"                      alt="restart android with power button"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> When the Vivo Y200 device turns off, wait a few seconds.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the Vivo Y200 device.</p><p>Check to see if the Android auto touch screen is not working problem has been resolved. Otherwise, proceed with the following methods.</p><h3 id="Turn-On-Safe-Mode"><a href="#Turn-On-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Turn On Safe Mode"></a>Turn On Safe Mode</h3><p>You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.</p><p>If your touch screen is functional in safe mode, the issue is most likely internal. You can quickly fix the Android touchscreen issue by following the prompts given below to activate the safe mode:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> To force a restart, press and hold the Vivo Y200 device’s “Power” button for an extended period.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> When you let go of the “Power” button, press and hold the “Volume Down” button. After that, a “Safe Mode” label will appear in your screen’s lower-left corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-2.JPG"                      alt="turn-on-safe-mode-android"                ></p><h3 id="Turn-Off-Developer-Options"><a href="#Turn-Off-Developer-Options" class="headerlink" title="Turn Off Developer Options"></a>Turn Off Developer Options</h3><p>Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.</p><p>If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Launch the <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select the <strong><strong>System</strong></strong> menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Advanced options menu, then select Developer Options.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> You will then find the switch to turn it on or off. Disable itby toggling the button off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-3.PNG"                      alt="turn off developer options in android"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 5:</strong></strong> Restart your device to check if the part of the touch screen not working issue has been resolved.</p><h3 id="Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings"><a href="#Reset-Device-to-Factory-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Device to Factory Settings"></a>Reset Device to Factory Settings</h3><p>Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Go to <strong>Find My Device</strong> from any d<strong><strong>evice</strong></strong> and sign in to the Google account associated with the damaged screen device.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> After successfully logging in, you will see your device’s name. Select the <strong><strong>Erase Device</strong></strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-4.JPG"                      alt="google find my device feature"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Confirm by pressing the <strong><strong>Erase Device</strong></strong> button.</p><p><strong><strong>Tip:</strong></strong> Since all your data will be removed, it’s recommended to <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/"><u>back up your data</u></a> first before resetting your device to factory settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-issue-on-android-5.JPG"                      alt="erase device to factory reset android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Fix-Using-a-Third-Party-App-–-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Fix-Using-a-Third-Party-App-–-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

So, if you’re having one of those days today, we are here to help. Camera app is one of the most used apps on smartphones today.

So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Vivo Y200. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Vivo Y200 right where you are, without needing to take the Vivo Y200 device to the manufacturer’s service center.</p><h3 id="II-I-Restart-The-Handset"><a href="#II-I-Restart-The-Handset" class="headerlink" title="II.I: Restart The Handset"></a>II.I: Restart The Handset</h3><p>One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Vivo Y200 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="restarting android handset"                ></p><p>Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.</p><h3 id="II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App"><a href="#II-II-Close-And-Relaunch-The-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App"></a>II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App</h3><p>If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.</p><h3 id="II-III-Check-App-Permissions"><a href="#II-III-Check-App-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="II.III: Check App Permissions"></a>II.III: Check App Permissions</h3><p>These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera and tap Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg"                      alt="clear camera app cache android"                ></p><h3 id="II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache"><a href="#II-V-Clear-The-Photo-Gallery-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache"></a>II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache</h3><p>The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg"                      alt="google play store app updates"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg"                      alt="check for app updates play store"                ></p><p>Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.</p><h3 id="II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down"><a href="#II-VII-Cool-The-Phone-Down" class="headerlink" title="II.VII: Cool The Phone Down"></a>II.VII: Cool The Phone Down</h3><p>We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.</p><p>If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.</p><h3 id="II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System"><a href="#II-VIII-Nudge-The-Camera-System" class="headerlink" title="II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System"></a>II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System</h3><p>You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.</p><h3 id="II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#II-IX-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue-In-One-Click-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)"></a>II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)</h3><p>Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre.

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Poco-M6-Pro-4G-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Poco M6 Pro 4G Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Poco M6 Pro 4G Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Poco M6 Pro 4G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Poco M6 Pro 4G functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Poco M6 Pro 4G, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Poco M6 Pro 4G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Poco M6 Pro 4G to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Poco M6 Pro 4G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Poco M6 Pro 4G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Poco M6 Pro 4G:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

This helps in clearing out any problem that might have disrupt the functioning of phone. So, to fix the problem of “Contacts app won’t open”, you too can try out your hand in this method.</p><ol><li>Get hold of your Android system and long press the power button.</li><li>This will fadeout the main screen and showcase several options from where you’ve to tap on “Reboot&#x2F;Restart” mode.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/restart-reboot-android-phone.jpg"                      alt="contacts app stopping - retart android"                ></p><p>Now, your device will quickly reboot the Vivo V29 Pro device. Once, the Vivo V29 Pro device regains its normal state, check whether the issue is coming again or not.</p><h3 id="2-2-Clear-cache-and-data-of-Contacts-app"><a href="#2-2-Clear-cache-and-data-of-Contacts-app" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Clear cache and data of Contacts app"></a>2.2 Clear cache and data of Contacts app</h3><p>The cache memory basically stashes the copies of the concerned application. It is indeed a streak of copies of the desired app storing information and incurring additional space on the storage. This might be the reason why the contact app crashes rapidly on your Vivo V29 Pro. Hence, it can prove to be a good remedy for this problem. Just follow down the steps mentioned below-</p><ol><li>First of all, go to “Settings” application from the app drawer or from the notification panel.</li><li>Now, surf and select for “Applications” or “Apps &amp; notifications”.</li><li>Here, you need to browse for “Contacts” app and open it.</li><li>On “Contacts” app, just tap on “CLEAR CACHE” and “CLEAR DATA” button. This will prompt the cache memory to be cleared.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-contacts-cache-data.jpg"                      alt="contacts app stopping - clear cache"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Wipe-cache-partition"><a href="#2-3-Wipe-cache-partition" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Wipe cache partition"></a>2.3 Wipe cache partition</h3><p>As we know the cache memories are the temporary files build by the firmware. These are of little importance as they are bound to become a bit more corrupted in nature. And sometimes, may indirectly become a hurdle for the working of contacts app. It is good if the Vivo V29 Pro device is cleared off from the caches. Instead of manually wiping down the cache memory, we will understand how to clear off the cache partition in the following steps.</p><ol><li>From device, just power off your device. Then, press the “Volume Down + Power” button with “Home” combinations together.</li><li>In a moment’s time, lose fingers from the “Power” button but do not release fingers from “Volume Down” and “Home” buttons.</li><li>Once you view the “Android System Recovery” screen, just lose the “Volume Down” and “Home” buttons.</li><li>Over the options available, just opt for “wipe cache partition” by tapping the “Volume down” button until the desired option is highlighted.</li><li>Finally, push the “Power” key to give consent to the selection.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/wipe-cache-partion.jpg"                      alt="contacts app stopping - wipe cache partition"                ></p><ol start="7"><li>After, the process is through there will be an option for “Reboot System Now”. Tap on it and restart the Vivo V29 Pro device.</li></ol><h3 id="2-4-Disable-Google-app"><a href="#2-4-Disable-Google-app" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Disable Google+ app"></a>2.4 Disable Google+ app</h3><p>The root cause for detecting any problem is not very easy. You never know the overloading of Google + application might have directly impacted contacts app crashes. To resolve it, disabling it may prove to be a helpful solution. Here is the quick reference for disabling Google+ application.</p><ol><li>First of all, visit “Settings” from your Vivo V29 Pro.</li><li>In “Settings”, visit the “Application Manager” or “Applications” menu and browse for “Google +” app.</li><li>From the application main page, you can choose to do either of the methods:</li></ol><ul><li>Either, completely disable the application to work by pressing on “Force stop” or “Disable” feature.</li><li>Or, brush away the unnecessary cache piled up on your storage by using “Clear Cache” functionality.</li></ul><p>There will be a prompt stating that the application may misbehave. However, you must disable the feature and check whether it worked out for you or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-google-plus-cache-data.jpg"                      alt="contacts app crashing - clear google+ cache"                ></p><h3 id="2-5-Update-your-device-software"><a href="#2-5-Update-your-device-software" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Update your device software"></a>2.5 Update your device software</h3><p>Many a times, we skip updating our device software thinking it is of less importance.

While it seems confusing, it’s a problem that some Android users have encountered.</p><p>After all, the presence of app icons on our Android device’s home screen is important for convenient access to our frequently used applications. When your Realme 11X 5G’s icons suddenly disappear, it can leave you feeling lost about how to use and access your apps.</p><p>No worries, though. We’ve got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you’ll get those <strong>missing app icons</strong> back on your Realme 11X 5G.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed"><a href="#Part-1-Make-Sure-if-the-Missing-App-Is-Installed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed"></a>Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed</h2><p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting the <strong>missing app icon on your Android</strong> device, it’s essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Reset Android to factory settings"></a>4. Reset Android to factory settings</h3><p>If the previous methods don’t work, you might need to do a <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html"><u>factory reset on your Realme 11X 5G</u></a>. But before doing that, it’s important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.</p><p>How to reset Android to factory setting:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Android Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Backup and Reset &gt; Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.</li></ul><p>Please be mindful that performing a factory reset on Android will reset your Android completely to its initial state.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-4.jpg"                      alt="Perform a factory reset on Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fix-System-Error-on-Android-Easily-with-Reliable-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software"></a>Part 3: How to Fix System Error on Android Easily with Reliable Software</h2><p><strong>Missing app icons on Android</strong> can sometimes be a result of errors in your Android system launcher, causing inconvenience and potential disruptions to your device’s operation.

The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Samsung-Galaxy-XCover-6-Pro-Tactical-Edition-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Samsung-Galaxy-XCover-6-Pro-Tactical-Edition-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users.

However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone.

We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your <strong>Sony Xperia 1 V touchscreen is not working</strong>, don’t worry – we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id="What-Causes-A-Sony-Xperia-1-V-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#What-Causes-A-Sony-Xperia-1-V-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="What Causes A Sony Xperia 1 V Screen Unresponsive?"></a>What Causes A Sony Xperia 1 V Screen Unresponsive?</h2><p>There are several reasons why a Sony Xperia 1 V phone’s screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It’s essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.</p><p>Below are some possible causes of Sony Xperia 1 V screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Soft-bricked software:</strong> Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Sony Xperia 1 V Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Sony Xperia 1 V device unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment is worn out:</strong> Hardware problems can also cause Sony Xperia 1 V screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Sony Xperia 1 V model, including the Y2 and 5A.</p></li><li><p>**Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Sony Xperia 1 V Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.</p></li></ul><h2 id="The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Sony-Xperia-1-V-Screen-Unresponsive"><a href="#The-Common-Solutions-To-Solve-A-Sony-Xperia-1-V-Screen-Unresponsive" class="headerlink" title="The Common Solutions To Solve A Sony Xperia 1 V Screen Unresponsive"></a>The Common Solutions To Solve A Sony Xperia 1 V Screen Unresponsive</h2><p>In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Sony Xperia 1 V screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues.

To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Play Store.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-1.jpg"                      alt="Check if the missing app is installed"                ></p><p>Now, see whether you can find the <strong>app icon that disappeared on your Android.</strong> If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Find-the-Missing-App-Icon-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android"></a>Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android</h2><p><em>“</em><strong><em>All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen.</em></strong> <em>What should I do?”</em></p><p>If you’ve confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don’t fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the <strong>missing app icon on Android</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-Check-hidden-apps"><a href="#1-Check-hidden-apps" class="headerlink" title="1. Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer"></a>2. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer</h3><p>If your <strong>app icon disappeared on your Android</strong>, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3. Re-enable disabled app"></a>3. Re-enable disabled app</h3><p><strong>App icons can also disappear on the Android</strong> home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn’t appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.</p><p>To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the <strong>phone icon disappears on your Android.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the App Info, tap Enable.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings"><a href="#4-Reset-Android-to-factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="4.

Then, tap the <strong>Virtual Location</strong> button on the home page and click <strong>Get Started</strong> on the pop-up window.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Connect your phone to Dr.Fone.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>To connect your phone to this all-in-one software, enable “transfer files” instead of “charging” on your phone.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Allow WhatsApp access to your device’s location and then press the <strong>Share Live Location</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-2.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Last but not least, set the duration your contact will view your location, add a comment, and tap the <strong>Send</strong> button. That’s it!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device’s location and then share it on WhatsApp.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone"></a>Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone</h2><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone is the perfect tool to handle all your WhatsApp issues.

There you will see the storage occupied by the app along with the cache.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-message-cache.jpg"                      alt="android not receiving texts clear cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click on the Clear Cache button and wait as the Infinix Smart 7 device free up the memory of your device.</p><p>Once the cache is cleared, you can also clear the data if you want to and you’ll instantly receive the text messages on your phone.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space"><a href="#Part-7-Delete-Useless-Messages-to-Free-Up-Space" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space"></a>Part 7: Delete Useless Messages to Free Up Space</h2><p>Sometimes, if you are not receiving text messages on Infinix Smart 7, it means that you need to clean up the clutter of useless messages from your phone and SIM both.

This is how you do it.</p><ul><li>Uninstall the app right away from your Homescreen or from the “Settings” &gt; “Applications” &gt; “All” &gt; “WhatsApp” &gt; “Uninstall” (for some phones).</li><li>Go to “Play Store” and search “WhatsApp” on the search bar.</li><li>Tap on it and start downloading followed by installing it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/install-whatsapp.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix component corruption"                ></p><h2 id="Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Cause-4-Not-Enough-Storage-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone"></a>Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone</h2><p>Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the Infinix Smart 7 device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.</p><ul><li>Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage. Make sure it is enough i.e. at least 100 to 200MB.</li><li>Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.</li></ul><h2 id="Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked"><a href="#Cause-5-Gmail-Account-no-longer-valid-or-hacked" class="headerlink" title="Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked"></a>Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked</h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Android device and Gmail account go hand in hand. To run the Infinix Smart 7 device smoothly, it is always asked to enter your Gmail address for further configurations. And when WhatsApp stops on your device, the reason might be your Gmail account. Most probably it is not valid now or maybe hacked. If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.</p><ul><li>Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.</li><li>Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/06/log-out-gmail.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp stopping - fix gmail account"                ></p><p>Now, you can login again and check if WhatsApp works or not.</p><h2 id="Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Cause-6-WhatsApp-Incompatible-with-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone"></a>Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone</h2><p>If still nothing works and your WhatsApp keeps stopping, most likely the reason is the incompatibility of your WhatsApp with your device. In such case, the thing that comes to your rescue is mod WhatsApp version like GBWhatsApp. It is a mod app which is similar to WhatsApp but in a more modified way. With this, a user gets more functionalities and customizable settings when compared to WhatsApp.</p><p>If you’re wondering how you can find this app and install, you should keep reading.</p><p><strong>To find GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Since you can look for this mod app on the Play Store, here are some of the other secure places from where you can download apk file for this GBWhatsApp. Note down these websites to get GBWhatsApp downloaded if WhatsApp has stopped.</p><ul><li>Latest Mod APKs</li><li>UptoDown</li><li>Android APKs Free</li><li>Soft Alien</li><li>OpenTechInfo</li></ul><p><strong>To Install GBWhatsApp:</strong></p><p>Now that you have decided where to download the apk file, these are the following steps that you should follow to install it on your phone.
