Why Is Your Huawei Nova Y91 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Huawei Nova Y91 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Huawei Nova Y91 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Huawei Nova Y91 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Huawei Nova Y91, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot.

Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Huawei Nova Y91 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery!

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the HTC U23 Pro device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the HTC U23 Pro device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the HTC U23 Pro device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key.

Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your HTC U23 Pro is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your HTC U23 Pro, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the HTC U23 Pro device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="9-Solutions-to-Fix-HTC-U23-Pro-System-Crash-Issue"><a href="#9-Solutions-to-Fix-HTC-U23-Pro-System-Crash-Issue" class="headerlink" title="9 Solutions to Fix HTC U23 Pro System Crash Issue"></a>9 Solutions to Fix HTC U23 Pro System Crash Issue</h2><p>Android crash, better known as Android system crash is not a recent issue and has troubled many users in the past as well.

Before you redirect to a proper solution for repairing your HTC U23 Pro system, you can try restarting your device as a quick remedy. Restart the Android device to clear temporary system data and potentially resolve any software glitches causing the crash, which can be done as follows:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Hold your HTC U23 Pro’s “Power” button on the side of the phone. As the following window appears on the screen, select the “Reboot” option to restart the Android device successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-1.jpg"                      alt="restart the android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Shut-down-unnecessary-running-apps"><a href="#Part-4-Shut-down-unnecessary-running-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Shut down unnecessary running apps"></a>Part 4: Shut down unnecessary running apps</h2><p>Another quick solution to avoid Android devices crashing is to shut down unnecessary apps running in the HTC U23 Pro device’s background. To cater to that, you need to try out the following steps as a remedy to shutting down unwanted applications:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the “Settings” of your HTC U23 Pro and continue to the “Battery and device care” section from the available options. Continue to the “Memory” section on the next window to lead to the applications taking up space on your HTC U23 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on battery and device care"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you progress further, you need to select the “Clean now” button to shut down all unnecessary background applications running on the Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-3.jpg"                      alt="press the clean now button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Uninstall-incompatible-Apps-to-fix-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-5-Uninstall-incompatible-Apps-to-fix-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Uninstall incompatible Apps to fix Android crash issue"></a>Part 5: Uninstall incompatible Apps to fix Android crash issue</h2><p>If your Android system crash takes place frequently but the HTC U23 Pro device turns on normally after that, there is a chance that some Apps may be causing the problem. Unnecessary and large App files burden the HTC U23 Pro device system and force it to crash every now and then. Make sure you download, install and store only those Apps which are fully compatible with your Android system. DO NOT download Apps from other unknown sources and use only Google Play store for the purpose. All other incompatible Apps must be deleted to prevent them from tweaking your software.</p><p>To uninstall unwanted and incompatible Apps, please follow the steps below.</p><p>1.

The need to free up space arouses the need to know about the potential steps for checking storage and cleaning up space, which is discussed as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to navigate into “Settings” and look for the “Battery and device care” section. As you lead next, select the “Storage” option to check the Android storage and see how it is segregated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-4.jpg"                      alt="open the storage settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you navigate to the next screen, you can free up space by removing the applications from your Android. For that, tap on “Apps” to open a section containing the list of applications installed on the Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-5.jpg"                      alt="access the installed apps info"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go through the list of applications and select any app you want to remove. As you navigate next, select “Uninstall” to lead to removing the app from the Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-6.jpg"                      alt="press the uninstall option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-7-Clear-cache-partition-to-fix-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-7-Clear-cache-partition-to-fix-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Clear cache partition to fix Android crash issue"></a>Part 7: Clear cache partition to fix Android crash issue</h2><p>Clearing cache is a good idea because it cleans your device and reduces the burden on the Android software and gives it enough space to function normally and carry out its operations.</p><p>In case the Android system crash issue is temporary, follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:</p><p>1. On your HTC U23 Pro, visit “Settings” and find “Storage”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14989068987919.jpg"                      alt="android settings"                ></p><p>2. Now tap on “Cached Data”, and then click “OK” to clear all unwanted cache from your device as shown above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992219452.jpg"                                     ></p><p>However, if the Android crash problem is such that your phone has frozen, becomes unresponsive, and does not turn on, you must first boot into the Recovery Mode screen.</p><p>1. Press the volume down button and power button together until you see a screen with multiple options before you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992495864.jpg"                      alt="boot in recovery mode"                ></p><p>2. Once you are on the Recovery Mode screen, use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992704405.jpeg"                      alt="wipe cache partition"                ></p><p>3. After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged-up and unwanted files and resolve the Android system crash issue. If clearing cache doesn’t help, try formatting your SD Card.</p><h2 id="Part-8-Remove-the-SD-card-to-fix-the-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-8-Remove-the-SD-card-to-fix-the-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Remove the SD card to fix the Android crash issue"></a>Part 8: Remove the SD card to fix the Android crash issue</h2><p>Removing and formatting your SD Card to fix the Android System crash issue is helpful when a corrupted SD Card disturbs the Android software forcing it to shut down suddenly.</p><p>To format your SD Card, just follow the instructions below.</p><p>1.

Provide Details of Your Android Device</li></ul><p>The system automatically identifies the brand of the Android device undergoing repair. Afterward, choose the “Name,” “Model,” “Country,” and “Carrier” from the provided list options. If the Tecno Phantom V Flip device is already unlocked, you can choose OPEN in the Carrier section. Then, confirm by checking the warning box indicating agreement and readiness to proceed.

To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-02.jpg"                      alt="drained iphone battery"                ></p><h3 id="App-Troubles"><a href="#App-Troubles" class="headerlink" title="App Troubles"></a>App Troubles</h3><p>If your <strong>phone is working, but the screen is black,</strong> there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application.

This restriction hampers your ability to explore and use valuable apps. It can also disrupt the smooth functioning of your daily digital activities. Before going for solutions, it is crucial to understand the reasons causing this restriction in installing apps on smartphones:</p><h3 id="1-Regional-Restrictions"><a href="#1-Regional-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="1. Regional Restrictions"></a>1. Regional Restrictions</h3><p>One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers. Developers often roll out their apps gradually across different regions. It is done to adhere to legal and licensing requirements. This staggered release strategy ensures compliance with local laws. Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.</p><h3 id="2-Licensing-and-Legal-Constraints"><a href="#2-Licensing-and-Legal-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="2.

It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.</p><h3 id="3-Localization-Challenges"><a href="#3-Localization-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3.

These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the <strong>Play Store app not available in your country.</strong></p><h3 id="4-Device-and-OS-Compatibility"><a href="#4-Device-and-OS-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="4.

Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app’s requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.</p><h3 id="5-Political-and-Economic-Factors"><a href="#5-Political-and-Economic-Factors" class="headerlink" title="5.

This issue has plagued Android users, causing app crashes, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-frozen/iphone-keeps-freezing.html" >freezing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and frustration. But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?</p><p>Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.</p><p>Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing <strong>Android WebView crash</strong>. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>App Freezing</strong></li></ul><p>One of the earliest signs of an <strong>Tecno Spark 10C Android System WebView crash</strong> is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.</p><ul><li><strong>Unexpected App Closures</strong></li></ul><p>Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. <strong>Tecno Spark 10C Android System WebView crashing apps</strong> can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.</p><ul><li><strong>Error Messages</strong></li></ul><p>Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash. These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg"                      alt="webview crash google app"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Slow Loading Times</strong></li></ul><p>Slow loading times can also be a sign of an impending crash. If webpages within the app take unusually long to load or images and other content appear pixelated or distorted, it could be a sign that Tecno Spark 10C Android System WebView is struggling to handle the workload.</p><p>But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Updates and Compatibility Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Updates are often intended to improve software stability and compatibility, but in some cases, they can introduce new bugs or compatibility issues that lead to crashes. It is particularly evident when app developers and WebView developers release updates that don’t fully align, causing conflicts.</p><ul><li><strong>Insufficient Memory</strong></li></ul><p>Tecno Spark 10C Android System WebView requires a certain amount of memory to operate properly. If your device is running low on memory, it can cause Tecno Spark 10C Android System WebView to crash. It is more likely to happen on older devices with less RAM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-03.jpg"                      alt="webview crash out of memory message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Outdated Tecno Spark 10C Android System WebView</strong></li></ul><p>The WebView app is responsible for rendering web content within Android apps. Using an outdated version of WebView can introduce known bugs and security vulnerabilities that can cause crashes.</p><ul><li><strong>Conflicts With Other Apps</strong></li></ul><p>WebView might crash if it conflicts with other resources or processes running on the Tecno Spark 10C device. It can happen if the Tecno Spark 10C device runs low on memory or other resource-intensive apps compete for system resources.</p><p>In the next section, you’ll explore potential solutions to keep your apps running smoothly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Android-WebView-Crashes-Here-Are-Quick-and-Proven-Solutions"><a href="#Part-2-Android-WebView-Crashes-Here-Are-Quick-and-Proven-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Android WebView Crashes?

This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive.

Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Poco X6 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Poco X6, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.</p><p>Over time, the touch screen of an Poco X6 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Poco X6 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.</p><p>Dropping or impacting an Poco X6 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Poco X6 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Poco X6 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Poco X6 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.</p><p>While Poco X6 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.</p><h2 id="How-to-Avoid-Poco-X6-Screen-Unresponsiveness-Issue"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Poco-X6-Screen-Unresponsiveness-Issue" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Poco X6 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue"></a>How to Avoid Poco X6 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue</h2><p>One of the most effective ways to prevent Poco X6 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the Poco X6 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen’s functionality.</p><p>Another way to avoid Poco X6 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Poco X6 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.</p><p>Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Poco X6 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it’s recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Poco X6 App Store.</p><p>Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Poco X6 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device’s software and data. With features such as System Repair and Data Backup &amp; Restore, you can quickly diagnose and fix software issues that may cause unresponsiveness and safely back up important data to prevent loss in case of device damage or malfunction.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Poco X6 Screen unresponsiveness can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are solutions available. Force restarting the Poco X6 device, checking for software updates, using Dr. Fone Repair, and contacting customer service are all effective ways to solve the problem. However, it’s also important to understand the possible causes of the issue, such as soft-bricking or equipment wearing out, and take preventative measures, such as updating your phone on time and avoiding malware.

But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?</p><p>Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.</p><p>Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing <strong>Android WebView crash</strong>. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>App Freezing</strong></li></ul><p>One of the earliest signs of an <strong>Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G Android System WebView crash</strong> is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.</p><ul><li><strong>Unexpected App Closures</strong></li></ul><p>Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. <strong>Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G Android System WebView crashing apps</strong> can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.</p><ul><li><strong>Error Messages</strong></li></ul><p>Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash.
