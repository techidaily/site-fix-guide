Available in six colorful silicone band options and a crisp AMOLED display, this fashionable wearable continuously monitors heart rate, sleep, and offers custom tracking for 12 different popular workouts.</p><p> I used this device for a little over a week while sleeping, hiking, and running to see how this stylish tracker delivered. Though tracking data was never an issue, the software and companion app fell short of delivering a truly intuitive, user-friendly experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135414/19272" target="_top" id="2135414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135414/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Lightweight-and-a-little-too-familiar"><a href="#Design-Lightweight-and-a-little-too-familiar" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lightweight and a little too familiar"></a>Design: Lightweight and a little too familiar</h2><p> The Amazfit GTS is a super-light device at approximately 24.8 grams but isn’t flimsy. The body is made with aircraft-grade aluminum alloy, and the Corning 3 Gorilla glass covering the display is conveniently smudge-resistant. The back of the display is decidedly more plastic-looking, though the plate is covered in a matte finish with a pleasantly sturdy feel. The square watch face is slightly longer than it is wide, akin to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-se-review-5088223" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In fact, if you don’t look too closely, this device is almost an exact copy of this outsize name in the wearable game.</p><p> Along with the crisp and easy-to-read display, the GTS’s biggest asset is the flexible and durable silicone with a healthy selection of notches and two tabs to keep the band in place once you’ve latched it.</p><p> The always-on 348x 442<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/super-amoled-4151073" >AMOLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display is very vibrant and easy to read with 1.65 inches of real estate. The main screen is also highly customizable. Two watch faces (one analog and one digital) come preloaded on the device (and more are available through the app), and most of the widgets on each option are editable to show the information that you want to view most frequently at a quick glance.</p><p> Along with the crisp and easy-to-read display, the GTS’s biggest asset is the flexible and durable silicone with a healthy selection of notches and two tabs to keep the band in place once you’ve latched it. Though it comes in a single size, I was able to find a comfortably close fit on my small 5.5-inch wrist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hMe1Ur0Wtt9LDIiSfC3zvE_5G7E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_02-0b1e98c2de40486b9fea116eb28ccd3c.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> I was unable to test this device’s 50-meter water resistance for swimming or other aquatic workouts, but I did wear it in the shower without experiencing any issue. The manufacturer does note, however, that this wearable isn’t safe for hot showers or other water sports such as scuba diving, diving, and high-speed water sports, generally.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Easy-to-wear-but-not-as-user-friendly"><a href="#Comfort-Easy-to-wear-but-not-as-user-friendly" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Easy to wear but not as user-friendly"></a>Comfort: Easy to wear but not as user-friendly</h2><p> While the Amazfit GTS is stylish enough to wear all day and easily coordinate with your wardrobe and comfortable to sleep with, confusing interface issues impaired overall ease of use. Along with the modular watch faces, there are screens for nearly every data point measured, accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the device.</p><p> Unlike most trackers, the top two data points on this tracker are Status (which is really steps logged) and PAI (personal physiological activity indicator, a number that’s calculated based on heart rate and activity). These aren’t common metrics most users are familiar with, and the way these widgets appear on the watch and in the app aren’t customizable.</p><p> It’s stylish enough to wear all day and comfortable enough to sleep with.</p><p> Swiping down from the top reveals other popular functions for adjusting brightness, locking the device, or entering sleep mode, but these seemingly simple options didn’t always perform as expected—and required the use of the side button, which serves as a back and multipurpose button, to exit out of.</p><p> One standout example is putting this device in sleep mode. Unlike most wearables that deactivate the display with a tap of a sleep icon, the Amazfit GTS presents several do-not-disturb options that aren’t clearly explained by the onboard descriptions. This felt like a severe limitation to the out-of-the-box comfort of this device, which extends to other areas such as viewing sleep and fitness data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BCJ0gqS-gzR_dq3WSGazLqPMNCk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_05-9f844a14ab734d9291e338b6fa2519da.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> While the display looks great and is responsive, the lack of clarity about certain menu options, both the meaning and how to activate them, and the lack of control over data widget order, takes a few points away from the overall stylish look.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148646/16836" target="_top" id="2148646">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148646" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148646/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Solid-GPS-and-decent-activity-tracking"><a href="#Performance-Solid-GPS-and-decent-activity-tracking" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid GPS and decent activity tracking"></a>Performance: Solid GPS and decent activity tracking</h2><p> The Amazfit GTS supports 12 common workout profiles, including running and walking, which I used the most. While it wasn’t spot-on compared with my usual tracking device, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-venu-review-4843916" >Garmin Venu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it wasn’t way off the mark. On one 3-mile run, the Amazfit GTS was less than 1 minute behind and the pace also followed suit at 9 seconds slower and 275 steps shorter, while heart rate was less accurate at about 15 beats faster than the Venu. Another pleasant consistency was the reliable onboard GPS and automatic stop&#x2F;start feature that worked fairly well, though with some delay.</p><p> The Amazfit GTS supports 12 common workout profiles, including running and walking, which I used the most.</p><p> The overall scope of data captured is relatively detailed and includes information runners appreciate like cadence and lap pace, but the app limits detailed or easy insights from the data since it doesn’t break down workout data by type and lumps everything together in weekly, monthly, or yearly views.</p><p> This device is also capable of tracking sleep data in a relatively extensive way, complete with sleep phases, times awake when you fell asleep and woke up. The watch never failed to track data and as far as I could tell, sleep and wake times were accurate, but reading the data was a little less straightforward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lrymbZEsmkXZy1YnjpGE5QutCbA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_04-109baf1e43444eff9789d9c02e2b2e77.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> While sleep data is elaborate, it’s presented in a way that requires a lot of scrolling or tapping back and forth across screens. For that reason, I never felt like I received a concise tip for bettering or understanding my sleep habits, which made the data feel a little too overwhelming and repetitive to make it approachable. This is an issue I had with referring to the app for any supplementary information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885932/19272" target="_top" id="1885932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-More-style-than-substance"><a href="#Software-More-style-than-substance" class="headerlink" title="Software: More style than substance"></a>Software: More style than substance</h2><p> The best fitness trackers and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartwatches-4048042" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also have intuitive companion apps, but that’s not a great strength of the Amazfit GTS. Like most<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/smart-watches-and-wearables-4781531" >wearables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Zepp app (formerly Amazfit) is required to initially set up the device and view tracked data in more detail.</p><p> Too often in the app and on the device itself, there seems to be a disconnect between the user and the data and how to get the information you’re looking for.</p><p> While the setup process was uncomplicated in terms of getting the watch to a usable state, I never felt at home in the app even after a week or so. I suspect that no amount of time would really change my experience with the placement and presentation of data points.</p><p> Too often in the app and on the device itself, there seems to be a disconnect between the user and the data and how to get the information you’re looking for. While there are many fields related to body measurements within the app that could offer a fuller wellness picture, they all seemingly require the extra step of manual input.</p><p> And besides the slew of features that are greyed out if not applicable to the device, there is too much ambiguity about coverage for other fields such as VO2 max and training load, which the Amazfit doesn’t seem to measure comprehensively—but which the app doesn’t make clear.</p><p> Also, the arrangement of data and explanations about how this data is sourced can feel like a bit of a maze to maneuver. There’s an icon in the upper-right corner of the app home screen that leads to all data, which is broken down into categories that aren’t wildly intuitive, such as Status data and Health sign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hqD81eq-Q8n6BPE_n48M4SpkIRA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazfit_GTS_Product_03-97749edaabac498bb95b0f8a9f569f0a.jpg"                      alt="Amazfit GTS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123726/7443" target="_top" id="2123726">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123726" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123726/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><p> Certain data points such as PAI, like other areas of the Zepp app, are backed by scientific citations and explanations of importance, but there’s just too much text to make any of it digestible or glanceable.</p><p> While I gathered that a PAI of 100 seemed to be ideal for cardiovascular health, the app further complicated things by suggesting, for example, a 120-minute indoor workout to gain 15 PAI. It was difficult to grasp why that would be worth it or realistic, and like many areas of the software, it felt more flashy and underdeveloped than insightful.</p><h2 id="Battery-Solid-but-considerably-shy-of-the-14-day-claim"><a href="#Battery-Solid-but-considerably-shy-of-the-14-day-claim" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Solid but considerably shy of the 14-day claim"></a>Battery: Solid but considerably shy of the 14-day claim</h2><p> The manufacturer bills the battery longevity at an impressive 14 days with typical usage in smartwatch mode, which includes continuous heart rate and sleep monitoring and logging workouts three times a week.</p><p> That’s pretty much the way I used this device, though with maybe an extra workout or two and with the display in always-on mode, and the battery drained by day seven. On the bright side, it recharged quickly in less than the manufacturer’s 2-hour estimate. Amazfit also claims that the battery can last up to 46 days in basic mode without Bluetooth or heart-rate monitoring turned on.</p><h2 id="Price-Slightly-pricey-for-what-it-is"><a href="#Price-Slightly-pricey-for-what-it-is" class="headerlink" title="Price: Slightly pricey for what it is"></a>Price: Slightly pricey for what it is</h2><p> The Amazfit GTS retails for about $120, though it’s possible to purchase it closer to $100. While it’s more on the budget-friendly end of the spectrum, its Apple Watch-adjacent design doesn’t extend to the benefit of the first-rate fitness technology you’ll find in its alter ego.</p><p> Spending between $100 to $130 for a style-conscious, band-style fitness tracker from heavy hitters such as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-fitbit-4176010" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Garmin could increase the tracking benefits considerably with extras like VO2 Max and SPO2 monitoring. For a little more (or less), gaining a user-friendly layout and companion app could be worth losing the Apple Watch aesthetic this device works hard to mirror.</p><h2 id="Amazfit-GTS-vs-Garmin-vivosmart-4"><a href="#Amazfit-GTS-vs-Garmin-vivosmart-4" class="headerlink" title="Amazfit GTS vs. Garmin vivosmart 4"></a>Amazfit GTS vs. Garmin vivosmart 4</h2><p> While the Amazfit GTS sort of looks like an Apple Watch, it doesn’t really come close to performing like one. The Garmin vivosmart 4 is much more in line with what the GTS delivers. For $130, this band-style tracker offers a streamlined design with a few upscale touches like metal finishings and attractive band colors, but it also analyzes much more than the GTS does. It tracks stress, VO2 max, blood oxygen saturation, and measures what Garmin calls body battery, which keeps you attuned to energy levels throughout the day.</p><p> The vivosmart 4 is also safe for swimming and offers<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone users the ability to respond directly to messages with canned replies, which the GTS lacks. Though the Amazfit GTS has a potential 2-week battery life in smart mode, the vivosmart 4 is good for a full week, which is on par with what I experienced from the GTS. And as a dedicated Garmin wearable user, I can attest to the generally more intuitive companion mobile app the vivosmart 4 and other models from this brand use over the Amazfit&#x2F;Zepp app.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A stylish fitness tracker with more potential than polish.</strong></p><p> The Amazfit GTS is comfortable and stylish and performs the basic fitness tracking tasks relatively well, but the confusing ecosystem diminishes the polish. If you love the look of the Apple Watch, this is a budget-friendly look-alike. But if you want a strong balance between performance and looks, the Amazfit GTS may not deliver.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-se-review-5088223" >Apple Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-sense-review-5085832" >Fitbit Sense <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-vivomove-hr-review-4843913" >Garmin Vivomove HR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151889/7443" target="_top" id="2151889">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151889/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  GTS Smartwatch</li><li>Product Brand  Amazfit</li><li>UPC  851572007573</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2019</li><li>Weight  0.87 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.7 x 1.43 x 0.37 in.</li><li>Color  Desert Gold, Lava Grey, Obsidian Black, Rose Pink, Steel Blue, Vermillion Orange</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Compatibility  iOS 10.0 and above, Android 5.0 and above</li><li>Battery Capacity  Up to 14 days</li><li>Water Resistance  Up to 50 meters</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-double-delight-maximizing-the-use-of-netflixs-floating-window/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Double Delight Maximizing the Use of Netflix's Floating Window</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/solved-warframe-update-failed-error/"><u>[Solved] Warframe Update Failed!

That is an easy fix if your Spotify has developed a bug. If that is the case, follow the next steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Try opening Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If it’s not working, open <strong>App Switcher</strong> or <strong>Recent Apps</strong>. Different Android devices open it differently.

Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Settings</strong>in the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg"                      alt="settings in spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap <strong>Log Out</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg"                      alt="log out of spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Log In</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-6.jpg"                      alt="log into spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter your login credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap <strong>Login</strong>again, and you’re in.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-7.jpg"                      alt="re-login to spotify with your credentials"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h3><p>Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Honor 100 Pro device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.

Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail"></a>Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail</h2><p>If an incoming call to your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:</p><ol><li>Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</li></ol><p>DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the <strong>Do not disturb</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb mode not enabled"                ></p><p>Here’s an alternative way:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Do not disturb</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg"                      alt="notifications settings interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> offto disable the mode.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Turn Off Call Forwarding</li></ol><p>One reason calls go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong> is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app on your device, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg"                      alt="phone dial app settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call forwarding</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg"                      alt="call settings supplementary services"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>Disable Call Barring</li></ol><p>If a phone <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Honor 100 Pro devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call barring</strong>, then tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Voice call</strong>, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls.

If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.</p><p>To check for updates, open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Software update</strong> or <strong>System update</strong>. For a seamless update experience, follow the step-by-step instructions on your mobile screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-07.jpg"                      alt="software update settings"                ></p><ol start="5"><li>Reset Network Settings</li></ol><p>If the incoming calls on your <strong>phone go straight to voicemail</strong>, consider resetting your phone’s network settings.

How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone"></a>Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone</h2><p>How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Honor 100 Pro device and halt it before the Honor 100 Pro device disables itself.</p><p>Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:</strong> Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer’s warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.</li><li>**Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system’s built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.</li><li>**Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.</li><li><strong>Backup your phone data regularly:</strong> Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.</li><li><strong>Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:</strong> Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is certainly upsetting when your gadget bricks, but you may attempt the solutions listed above to resolve the issue.

The steps may vary slightly depending on the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.

This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.</p><h3 id="Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone"><a href="#Physical-Damage-to-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Physical Damage to the Phone"></a>Physical Damage to the Phone</h3><p>If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your <strong><strong>phone getting stuck on the logo.</strong></strong></p><h3 id="Liquid-Damage"><a href="#Liquid-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Liquid Damage"></a>Liquid Damage</h3><p>It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.</p><p>Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your <strong><strong>phone stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.</p><p>For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone water indicator"                ></p><h3 id="Software-Issues"><a href="#Software-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Software Issues"></a>Software Issues</h3><p>Software issues are probably the most common reason your <strong><strong>phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.</p><p>The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the <strong><strong>phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.</strong></strong> Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.</p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-3-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your phone is <strong><strong>stuck on the startup screen</strong></strong> page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.</p><h3 id="Hard-reboot-your-phone"><a href="#Hard-reboot-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Hard reboot your phone"></a>Hard reboot your phone</h3><p>To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot.

For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup.

You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.</p><ol start="3"><li>How to prevent a boot loop?</li></ol><p>A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle.

Regional Restrictions"></a>1. Regional Restrictions</h3><p>One of the primary culprits behind this issue is the regional restrictions imposed by developers.

Moreover, it guarantees a smooth user experience tailored to specific geographical locations.</p><h3 id="2-Licensing-and-Legal-Constraints"><a href="#2-Licensing-and-Legal-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="2.

Developers may encounter licensing issues. This can prevent them from offering their apps in certain regions. It is due to copyright, trademark, or other legal considerations. Navigating the complex web of international laws and agreements is a big hassle. It becomes a determining factor in the availability of apps on the Play Store.</p><h3 id="3-Localization-Challenges"><a href="#3-Localization-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="3.

These incorporate language, cultural, and regulatory considerations to enhance user experience. The absence of proper localization can render an app incompatible with specific regions. It includes factors such as adapting the app for different languages, currencies, and cultural nuances. This can result in the app being excluded from the <strong>Play Store app not available in your country.</strong></p><h3 id="4-Device-and-OS-Compatibility"><a href="#4-Device-and-OS-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="4. Device and OS Compatibility"></a>4. Device and OS Compatibility</h3><p>The compatibility between the app, the user’s device, and its OS is another factor that contributes to this issue. Developers might restrict their app availability to certain devices or OS versions. It can restrict access for users whose devices or OS do not meet the app’s requirements. This technical limitation adds another layer to the complexity of app availability.</p><h3 id="5-Political-and-Economic-Factors"><a href="#5-Political-and-Economic-Factors" class="headerlink" title="5.

Or possibly, it may freeze after getting opened thereby hampering the Vivo Y78t device’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/fix-unfortunately-settings-has-stopped.jpg"                      alt="unfortunately settings has stopped"                ></p><p>Well!

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Vivo Y78t and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”. Therefore, go accordingly without getting confused.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Clear-the-Android-phone’s-RAM-and-retry"><a href="#Part-2-Clear-the-Android-phone’s-RAM-and-retry" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry"></a>Part 2: Clear the Android phone’s RAM and retry</h2><p>As the next tip, we would like to suggest you clear your device’s RAM by ceasing the running apps in the background. RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Vivo Y78t device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings. Also, if the apps in the background keep running, they might conflict with the Settings and stop it to perform properly. Therefore clearing RAM is important when Android Settings is not responding. Here is how to do it.</p><ol><li>Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.<br> Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Vivo Y78t device you own.</li><li>Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option. You will be able to notice the amount of RAM cleared</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-ram.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear ram"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Uninstall-the-Google-update"><a href="#Part-3-Uninstall-the-Google-update" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Uninstall the Google update"></a>Part 3: Uninstall the Google update</h2><p>Uninstalling Google Play Store updates has also responded well to many users. It has worked in the case of the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error. So, we would also like to suggest you use this tip if the others don’t work. Here are the steps to be followed for this.</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Android and tap on “Application manager” or “Apps” or “Application.</li><li>Now, head to all the apps and select “Google Play Store” from there.</li><li>Tap on “Uninstall Updates” and restart your device to check if the crashing Settings issue has been resolved.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/uninstall-google-update.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - uninstall update"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915870/19272" target="_top" id="1915870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915870/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Uninstall-the-custom-ROM-or-re-flash-the-stock-ROM"><a href="#Part-4-Uninstall-the-custom-ROM-or-re-flash-the-stock-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Uninstall the custom ROM or re-flash the stock ROM"></a>Part 4: Uninstall the custom ROM or re-flash the stock ROM</h2><p>Using a custom ROM on your device brings up this problem due to incompatibility or improper installation.

Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Itel P55+ devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Itel P55+ keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Itel P55+ gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657386/16446" target="_top" id="1657386">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657386" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657386/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone"></a>Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone</h2><p>As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html" >Itel P55+ S22 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying.

The steps may vary slightly depending on the Realme V30T device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.

Common Causes</h2><p>Experiencing a <strong>cell phone blank screen</strong> is not exclusive to Android or iOS users. A <strong>phone screen not turning on</strong> happens all the time due to several factors that may or may not be out of your control. While they can be frustrating, here are some common causes you should know as to why <strong>your phone screen went black but still works.</strong></p><h3 id="A-Drained-Battery"><a href="#A-Drained-Battery" class="headerlink" title="A Drained Battery"></a>A Drained Battery</h3><p>The first thing that comes to mind when your <strong>phone screen suddenly goes black</strong> is you have a drained battery. Even though this is obvious, it’s still important to mention, as this is usually what most people encounter. To fix this problem, plug your smartphone into a charger and wait for your device to turn on again. If it works, then you just prevented a rather annoying experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-02.jpg"                      alt="drained iphone battery"                ></p><h3 id="App-Troubles"><a href="#App-Troubles" class="headerlink" title="App Troubles"></a>App Troubles</h3><p>If your <strong>phone is working, but the screen is black,</strong> there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application.

This problem suggests that your Realme V30T is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.</p><h3 id="Hardware-Problem"><a href="#Hardware-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Problem"></a>Hardware Problem</h3><p>If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a <strong>black screen but your phone is still on.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-03.jpg"                      alt="loose samsung galaxy lcd"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Black-Screen-on-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Black-Screen-on-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Black Screen on Your Phone"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Black Screen on Your Phone</h2><p>Here are four valuable methods you should know on <strong>what to do when your phone screen goes black</strong> on your iPhone or Android smartphone to get them working again.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Force-Restart-your-Android-iOS-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-1-Force-Restart-your-Android-iOS-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Force Restart your Android&#x2F;iOS Smartphone"></a>Method 1: Force Restart your Android&#x2F;iOS Smartphone</h3><p>If your <strong>phone screen is black but still works,</strong> force restarting it is the easiest way to fix it.

Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Realme V30T devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Realme V30T keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Realme V30T gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone"></a>Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone</h2><p>As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html" >Realme V30T S22 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

Sometimes, it’s the phone that’s causing a problem, so to resolve it, you can follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Firstly, unlock your phone. Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, select the ‘Reboot’ option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="select reboot option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check Router Settings"></a>Fix 2: Check Router Settings</h3><p>If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings. This is because your phone might be blocked from connecting to the network, and if this is the scenario, your phone will never maintain the connection. You should check the Router’s admin panel or app to remove your phone from the blocklist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-2.jpg"                      alt="check router settings"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network"><a href="#Fix-3-Reconnect-to-Network" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reconnect to Network"></a>Fix 3: Reconnect to Network</h3><p>To fix the annoying problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, you should try forgetting the network and then reconnecting to it. This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the ‘Forget Network’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg"                      alt="click on forgot network"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg"                      alt="enter wifi password"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934288/19272" target="_top" id="1934288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934288/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Restart Your Router"></a>Fix 4: Restart Your Router</h3><p>As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Realme V30T device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg"                      alt="open wifi settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896541/19272" target="_top" id="1896541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896541/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You will see a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you have connected to previously.

Check Recently Installed Applications"></a>Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications</h3><p>Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying. Android users can easily get over this problem by resetting the network settings. The steps for this fix are as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For resetting the network, start by opening the ‘Settings’ menu on your phone. Then, scroll down, look for the ‘Connection &amp; Sharing’ option, and select it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-10.jpg"                      alt="access connect and sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: As you progress onto a new screen, you will find the option of “Reset Wi-Fi, Mobile Networks, and Bluetooth” in the menu. Select the option to lead to the next window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-11.jpg"                      alt="open reset option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on the option of “Reset Settings” present on the bottom of the next screen that shows up. Provide confirmation of resetting these settings by inserting your device’s PIN, if any.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-12.jpg"                      alt="click on reset settings button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: After providing the appropriate clearances, you will be asked for another confirmation of resetting the Realme V30T device’s networks to default.

For this, you can consider changing and modifying your AP (Access Point) band on your router.</p><p>Although the 5GHz frequency band is recognized for providing better network speeds, this band has a shorter range as compared to the 2.4GHz band, which has a better coverage of area. You can easily shift your router’s range through its configuration page. It is considered optimal to utilize the 2.4GHz frequency band for better ranges.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-14.jpg"                      alt="change routers range"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-9-Stay-Connected-while-Asleep"><a href="#Fix-9-Stay-Connected-while-Asleep" class="headerlink" title="Fix 9: Stay Connected while Asleep"></a>Fix 9: Stay Connected while Asleep</h3><p>Most Android phones have a battery-saving feature.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key.

Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="What-To-Do-When-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-Has-Black-Screen-of-Death"><a href="#What-To-Do-When-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro-Has-Black-Screen-of-Death" class="headerlink" title="What To Do When Lava Yuva 2 Pro Has Black Screen of Death?"></a>What To Do When Lava Yuva 2 Pro Has Black Screen of Death?</h2><p>Have you ever got the error of freezing the Android device home screen?

This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.</p><p>With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.</p><p>To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition to the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-tiktok-video-amplification/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to TikTok Video Amplification</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-asus-leads-the-charge-with-their-mg28uq-the-future-of-4k-monitors/"><u>[Updated] ASUS Leads the Charge with Their MG28UQ - The Future of 4K Monitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-eliminating-robotic-ratings-to-grow-views/"><u>[Updated] Eliminating Robotic Ratings to Grow Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-rise-on-youtube-initiating-your-chanel-and-earning-pathway/"><u>[Updated] Rise on YouTube Initiating Your Chanel & Earning Pathway</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pioneering-the-future-of-video-conferencing-with-google-meet-to-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved Pioneering the Future of Video Conferencing with Google Meet to YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/become-a-master-at-kinemaster-strategies-features-and-top-online-gaming-rivals-for-2024/"><u>Become a Master at KineMaster Strategies, Features, and Top Online Gaming Rivals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/clearstreams-eclipse-antenna-unmatched-performance-wrapped-in-simplicity/"><u>ClearStream's Eclipse Antenna - Unmatched Performance Wrapped in Simplicity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-itel-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Itel S23+? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-motorola-edge-2023-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Motorola Edge 2023 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-vivo-y100-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Vivo Y100 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-change-location-on-yik-yak-for-your-infinix-hot-40i-to-enjoy-more-fun-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Change Location on Yik Yak For your Infinix Hot 40i to Enjoy More Fun | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-tiktok-to-see-more-content-on-your-vivo-v29-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Vivo V29 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/key-features-to-consider-for-ultimate-gaming-screens/"><u>Key Features to Consider for Ultimate Gaming Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/quick-fixes-for-why-is-my-oppo-f23-5g-black-and-white-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Quick Fixes for Why Is My Oppo F23 5G Black and White | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reasons-for-oneplus-nord-ce-3-lite-5g-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G Stuck on Startup Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/reasons-for-samsung-galaxy-f34-5g-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Reasons for Samsung Galaxy F34 5G Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/solved-warning-camera-failed-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Solved Warning Camera Failed on Realme Narzo 60 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-how-to-bypass-swipe-screen-to-unlock-on-nokia-c300-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide How to Bypass Swipe Screen to Unlock on Nokia C300 Device</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In 2023, the use of ChatGPT in crypto trading became evident, as this chatbot is a hub of information. However, there are some reasons why using ChatGPT to trade cryptocurrency may be a bad idea.</p><h2 id="1-Lack-of-Real-Time-Data"><a href="#1-Lack-of-Real-Time-Data" class="headerlink" title="1. Lack of Real-Time Data"></a>1. Lack of Real-Time Data</h2><p> The cryptocurrency market is always changing. A coin can be worth $10 on Monday and then $5 on Tuesday. Because of this, real-time data is crucial in crypto trading, be it prices, trends, or predictions. Using outdated information can result in poor investments and a loss of funds, so it’s important to be on top of things.</p><p> Because ChatGPT has only been trained with data up to September 2021, it cannot provide up-to-date information on the crypto market. Without real-time data, it becomes almost impossible to make a wise crypto trading decision, so it’s best not to rely on ChatGPT entirely here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134229/18498" target="_top" id="2134229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134229/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-AI-Hallucinations-and-Potential-Biases"><a href="#2-AI-Hallucinations-and-Potential-Biases" class="headerlink" title="2.

In other words, it does not provide the expected response. This can happen in a number of scenarios and is possible in ChatGPT.</p><p> For instance, you may give ChatGPT unrealistic prompts that it cannot fulfill. At this point, the chatbot may give you an untrue answer simply to satisfy your query as best it can. The chatbot doesn’t know it’s lying but thinks the information it’s giving you is appropriate, despite that not being the case.</p><p> If ChatGPT hallucinates when you’re trying to reach a crypto trading or investment decision, and ChatGPT hallucinates, you could make a poor decision and lose money.</p><p> If you’re worried about AI hallucination, there are some<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prevent-ai-hallucination/" >things you can do it avoid it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Additionally, ChatGPT can fall victim to biases, which can affect the accuracy of its response. Sample bias, political bias, courtesy bias, and ignorance bias have all been identified as a possibility when using ChatGPT, which could be bad news for crypto traders.</p><p> ChatGPT can hold a bias in certain scenarios due to its training data. According to<a class="link"   href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/gpt-3/" >BBC Science Focus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ChatGPT was fed with an incredible 570GB of data from various sources, including books, journals, news articles, and Wikipedia. Most of this information was written by humans who hold biases, conscious or not. Even if less than 1% of ChatGPT’s training data is biased, that still poses a problem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135419/19272" target="_top" id="2135419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135419/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Fails-to-Give-Personalized-Financial-Advice"><a href="#3-Fails-to-Give-Personalized-Financial-Advice" class="headerlink" title="3.

But while this is possible, it may not be the best route to pursue.</p><p> ChatGPT knows more than any one human could ever know. But ChatGPT wasn’t specifically designed to provide financial advice. ChatGPT is a jack-of-all-trades chatbot, meaning it can answer questions on almost any topic. But this also means the tool is not fully equipped for hyper-specific or niche prompts.</p><p> Because ChatGPT knows nothing about your financial circumstances, delivering personalized financial advice is tough. How much you have to spend, your preferred platforms, your spending habits, how much you can afford to lose, and the profit you’re looking to make must all be considered, and this may end up being too much for ChatGPT.</p><p> This may result in the chatbot telling you it cannot satisfy your request or in AI hallucination, leading to an inaccurate response.</p><h2 id="4-Relies-Heavily-on-Historical-Data"><a href="#4-Relies-Heavily-on-Historical-Data" class="headerlink" title="4.

What ChatGPT can do is interpret what you’re saying and provide you with an interpretable response using its training data.</p><p> ChatGPT can be friendly and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/can-ai-make-us-laugh/" >even make jokes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but this is all based on the data it has been trained with. You could certainly call it a smart program, as it is highly advanced by today’s standards, but it is not an all-knowing entity.</p><p> It’s very important to remember this, as it’s easy to assume you’re getting crypto advice and statistics from a genius-level AI system when that isn’t the case. You should never use ChatGPT as a substitute for professional financial advice or up-to-date sources because of this heavy reliance on historical data.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130885/7443" target="_top" id="2130885">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130885" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130885/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Lacks-Insights-Into-Macroeconomic-Factors"><a href="#5-Lacks-Insights-Into-Macroeconomic-Factors" class="headerlink" title="5. Lacks Insights Into Macroeconomic Factors"></a>5. Lacks Insights Into Macroeconomic Factors</h2><p> The crypto market is tied to the traditional market in ways you’d never expect. If something big goes wrong in the traditional financial industry, chances are the ripples will be felt by the crypto industry. After all, people use traditional money to buy crypto, so it’s natural for the two markets to interlink.</p><p> But this evident relationship means that macroeconomic factors should be considered when making a crypto investment or trading decision. For instance, you should consider your residential country’s inflation and interest rates before delving into crypto, as an oncoming market hiccup, or even a crash, may cause a coin’s demand to plummet.</p><p> Say you bought a single crypto coin for $100 on Monday. The next day, your government announces a rise in interest rates. This means that anyone borrowing money is worse off, and may lead to people selling off their crypto to have more fiat currency. If thousands of people offload their holding of the crypto you invested in on Monday, its demand will plummet.</p><p> Once supply exceeds demand, prices drop. Now, the coin you bought is only worth $70. The next day, it may be worth less, and this is all because of a traditional market issue.</p><p> Because ChatGPT doesn’t have access to real-time data, it cannot consider these kinds of macroeconomics when giving investment and trading advice. Nine out of ten times, this may not matter, but there’s always a chance of receiving advice from ChatGPT when the tool itself hasn’t considered all the necessary factors in its response.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ChatGPT-Is-Revolutionary-but-Far-From-Perfect"><a href="#ChatGPT-Is-Revolutionary-but-Far-From-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Is Revolutionary but Far From Perfect"></a>ChatGPT Is Revolutionary but Far From Perfect</h2><p> There’s no denying that ChatGPT can help you in a myriad of ways, be it in research, writing, idea generation, or creativity.

Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Settings</strong>in the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg"                      alt="settings in spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap <strong>Log Out</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg"                      alt="log out of spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Log In</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-6.jpg"                      alt="log into spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter your login credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap <strong>Login</strong>again, and you’re in.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-7.jpg"                      alt="re-login to spotify with your credentials"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h3><p>Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android.

Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Motorola Moto G04 devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Motorola Moto G04 keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Motorola Moto G04 gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects.

But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.</p><p>Although there are ways to bypass the “<strong>Can’t take screenshot due to security policy</strong>” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.</p><p>If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/download-the-intel-8259v-graphics-driver-at-no-cost-instant-guide/"><u>Download the Intel 8259V Graphics Driver at No Cost: Instant Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/fixes-for-r-type-final-2-pc-game-crash-issues-steps-to-stability/"><u>Fixes for R-Type Final 2 PC Game Crash Issues: Steps to Stability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/high-performance-hardware-for-live-video-feeds-for-2024/"><u>High-Performance Hardware for Live Video Feeds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-of-honor-90-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Phone Touchscreen Of Honor 90 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-flash-dead-samsung-galaxy-s23-safely-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Flash Dead Samsung Galaxy S23 Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-huawei-p60-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Huawei P60 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-detailed-vpna-fake-gps-location-free-review-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On OnePlus Ace 2 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-find-my-friends-work-on-honor-magic-5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does find my friends work on Honor Magic 5 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-google-pixel-8-pro-location-on-skout-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Google Pixel 8 Pro Location on Skout | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-tiktok-to-see-more-content-on-your-gionee-f3-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Gionee F3 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-oppo-a1-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Oppo A1 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/lightroom-enthusiasts-ultimate-toolkit-the-1-list-of-top-10-luts-for-2024/"><u>LightRoom Enthusiast’s Ultimate Toolkit The #1 List of Top 10 LUTs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/nubia-red-magic-9-pro-screen-unresponsive-heres-how-to-fix-it-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

The steps may vary slightly depending on the Nubia Z50S Pro device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.
