However, Apple’s artificial intelligence isn’t perfect, and oftentimes, your Apple devices will make an error and save the wrong person in someone else’s album. This can happen due to the poor quality of a picture, the similarities of someone’s face, or various other reasons.</p><p> Here’s how you can review photos of identified people in the Photos app and fix any cases of mistaken identity, where your iPhone has tagged one person as someone else.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Review-People-in-Photos-on-an-iPhone-or-iPad"><a href="#How-to-Review-People-in-Photos-on-an-iPhone-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to Review People in Photos on an iPhone or iPad"></a>How to Review People in Photos on an iPhone or iPad</h2><p> To search for any misidentified photos of someone, you should first review your confirmed and uncategorized photos for that person to help your device learn what each person is supposed to look like.

Well! You can go for a spoofing app for this too. There are lots of them available at the Google Play Store. For more clarity, we will help you know how you can use a spoofer app for Life360 fake location. Make sure to go along with the steps carefully.</p><p>Before you get the app worked, here is a requirement you need to follow. The requirement simply says you to enable the developer options in your Apple iPhone SE. If you know how to do it, it’s good. But if you don’t here are the steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open “Settings” in the first place and tap on “System”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-1.jpg"                      alt="enable developer options"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, you need to go to the “About Phone” option. Followed by this, head to “Software info”.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will find the build number of your device here. You have to tap on it nearly 7 times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-2.jpg"                      alt="build number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, enter the lock code when asked and the developer options will be enabled.</p><h3 id="Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer"></a>Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Now that you have turned on the developer options, you can visit the Play Store and look for Fake GPS Location app. Install it on your phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, again go to “Settings” &gt; “System” &gt; “Developer Options”. Look for the “Select mock location app” and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/select-mock-location-app.jpg"                      alt="select mock location app from settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Fake GPS app as the mock location app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/select-app-android.jpg"                      alt="set Fake GPS app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the app now and choose the location you wish to fake and hit on the Play button.

This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.</p><ul><li>Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone&#x2F;Android.</li><li>Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.</li><li>There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.</p><h3 id="6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings"><a href="#6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings"></a>6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings</h3><p>Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> At the lower right corner, hit on “Settings”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg"                      alt="settings of Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hit on “Location Sharing”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg"                      alt="go to Location Sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying “Location Sharing Paused” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing for Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><ol><li><strong>How do I delete my history on Life360?</strong></li></ol><p>While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won’t suffice.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, it’s possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your Apple iPhone SE without needing to jailbreak the Apple iPhone SE device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?</strong></li></ol><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.</p><ol start="4"><li> <strong>If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?</strong></li></ol><p>Disabling Wi-Fi on your Apple iPhone SE might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device’s location services.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option. We discussed some helpful ways <strong>how to fake your location on Life360</strong> in this article, including <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which allows you to manipulate your GPS location, simulate routes, and set up geofences, making it a versatile solution for your location spoofing needs.

Please contact your cellular carrier and try again”. This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.</p><p>As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it’s not certain. To avoid this, let us read what we should know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-Life360-Location-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?"></a>Part 1: Why is Life360 Location Wrong?</h2><h3 id="Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks"><a href="#Interference-From-Nearby-Devices-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks"></a>Interference From Nearby Devices&#x2F;Networks</h3><p>In some cases, Life360 may not be able to determine the location of your device because it is being interfered with by other nearby devices or networks. For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.</p><h3 id="Poor-Signal"><a href="#Poor-Signal" class="headerlink" title="Poor Signal"></a>Poor Signal</h3><p>A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you’re commuting, is the most common cause of Life360’s incorrect location. When your phone is in a poor signal area, the app will use the internet instead of cellular data to determine the location of your contacts.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the network lines to determine whether or not this is indeed the source of the problem that prevents your Life360 from being found.</p><p>To get more information about how often does life360 update location, read about the Life360: Learn How Everything Works!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-Life360-Shows-Wrong-Location-Issue"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-Life360-Shows-Wrong-Location-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?"></a>Part 2: How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location Issue?</h2><p>There are several ways to fix the Life360app problems that life360 not updating its location.

If you notice that life360 is displaying the wrong location, you should examine your Internet connection settings to prevent life360 from displaying an inaccurate location.</p><p>Switch off the option that saves power and then turn on the wireless Internet connection.</p><p>You may turn off your smartphone’s power-saving mode by heading to the status bar and selecting the appropriate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_1.jpg"                      alt="review the internet settings"                ></p><p>Please note that this is just for Android users. Also, do not forget to consider that your Android smartphone’s settings may vary from those listed below.</p><p>The “switch off low power mode” option may be found in the “Settings”&gt; “Battery” menu on an iOS device.</p><p>Android users should also follow this procedure if life360 displays an incorrect location. For battery conservation, numerous programs are disabled when the low power state is engaged.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Double-check-Your-Current-Location-in-the-Settings"><a href="#Method-2-Double-check-Your-Current-Location-in-the-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings"></a>Method 2: Double-check Your Current Location in the Settings</h3><p>If life360 shows the incorrect location, the smartphone’s location services significantly come into play. The location settings must be activated to prevent the life360 location issue, and the current program must be updated accordingly.</p><p>Scrolling horizontally on the status bar on an Android device is all that is required for consumers to visit the website. Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg"                      alt="double-check your current location"                ></p><p>You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting “Settings,” followed by “General,” and then selecting “Background App Refresh.” Next, launch the location services function by navigating to “Settings”&gt; “Privacy”&gt; “location services” and selecting “Location Services” from the drop-down menu.</p><p>After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change “Allow Location Access” to “Always” and “Enable Precise Location.”</p><h3 id="Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time"><a href="#Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time"></a>Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time</h3><p>Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user’s location might be incorrectly determined.</p><p>If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data. Use a single device to log into life360 to prevent the issue of a wrong location showing up.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Keep-Your-Location-on-Life360-in-One-Place" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?"></a>Part 3: How to Keep Your Location on Life360 in One Place?</h2><p>Two of the most important and easy ways to keep your location on life360 in one place are:</p><h3 id="1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions"><a href="#1-Stopping-both-Wi-Fi-and-Cellular-Data-Transmissions" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition to the fact that you’re unable to use the internet, people in your circle will notice something wrong. In addition, it may not be adequate to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_3.jpg"                      alt="stopping both wi-fi and cellular data transmissions"                ></p><p>Those with an iPhone have the advantage of being able to disable the usage of cellular data directly inside the application’s settings. However, those with an Android device will need to resort to other approaches.</p><p>iPhone users may access the Cellular setting by going to the Settings app and tapping on it. This will switch off the cellular data for the Life360 app. Turn off Life360 by swiping the switch to the off position mentioned above.

Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

And finally the detailed step by step tutorial will help you get along with faking gps location smoothly.</p><h2 id="Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus"><a href="#Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Will iSpoofer update On Apple iPhone 15 Plus"></a>Will iSpoofer update On Apple iPhone 15 Plus</h2><p>iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer.

You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.</p><p>As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="change-location-registered-pic-10"                ></p><p>It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/-compre-written-in-code-deciphering-youtube-backlink-building-techniques/"><u>[New] A Compre Written in Code  Deciphering YouTube Backlink Building Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-fb-video-download-top-5-tools-list/"><u>[New] In 2024, FB Video Download  Top 5 Tools List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-engaging-dialogues-for-your-vlog-showcase/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Engaging Dialogues for Your Vlog Showcase</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-embarking-on-the-online-world-starting-a-facebook-life-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Embarking on the Online World  Starting a Facebook Life for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vr-content-company-you-should-know-within/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, VR Content Company You Should Know With.in</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-step-by-step-tutorial-personalize-and-elevate-your-short-videos/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Tutorial  Personalize and Elevate Your Short Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pro-video-enhancement-ranking-the-superior-15-gopro-lut-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Pro Video Enhancement  Ranking the Superior 15 GoPro LUT Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revolutionize-gaming-sounds-ps5ps4-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  Revolutionize Gaming Sounds  PS5/PS4 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unite-auditory-elements-with-visuals-in-ppt/"><u>2024 Approved  Unite Auditory Elements with Visuals in PPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/academic-anchors-identifying-top-10-lecture-preservation-tools-for-2024/"><u>Academic Anchors  Identifying Top 10 Lecture Preservation Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/best-3-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-pro-5g-emulator-for-mac-to-run-your-wanted-android-apps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best 3 Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G Emulator for Mac to Run Your Wanted Android Apps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/1719578733187-efficient-norge-language-skills-10-minute-routine/"><u>Efficient Norge Language Skills, 10-Minute Routine</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-realme-gt-5-pro-find-my-friends-no-location-found-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fix Realme GT 5 Pro Find My Friends No Location Found?

However, if My Apple iPhone 14 Plus was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Apple iPhone 14 Plus sit untouched for an hour….. YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!”</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Thompson.</td><td>“Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren’t available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you’d charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user.”</td></tr><tr><td>Gerald</td><td>“It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone?

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-deciding-filmora-vs-democracy-creator/"><u>[New] Deciding  Filmora Vs.

However, if My Apple iPhone 12 Pro was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Apple iPhone 12 Pro sit untouched for an hour….. YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!”</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Thompson.</td><td>“Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren’t available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you’d charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user.”</td></tr><tr><td>Gerald</td><td>“It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you’re interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg"                      alt="change region without vpn netflix"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions"></a>Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions</h2><p>Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.</p><p>Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix’s Terms of Use. If you’re caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you’re interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg"                      alt="change region without vpn netflix"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions"></a>Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions</h2><p>Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works.</em></td><td>4.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Once you change the country’s location on Google Play manually, the Play Store requires 48 hours to accept this modification. Moreover, you can only change the country’s server location once a year. With VPN, many country servers are unreachable, and some servers can be reached only through a paid version. This makes the process expensive and time taking.</p><p>To avoid these hurdles and chaos, we recommend you to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location to fake your location on both Android and iOS devices. This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click.

The home location will apply to all the Vivo Y27 5G devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device.

For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.</p><p>In this situation, you can simply run the <strong><em>Life360 app on PC</em></strong>.

But what’s better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic GPS movement:</strong> Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.</li><li><strong>Manual GPS movement:</strong> Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.</li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-enhance-your-photos-on-instagram-with-easy-free-filters-access/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enhance Your Photos on Instagram with Easy, Free Filters Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-snug-scenes-for-snowy-screens-a-focused-list/"><u>[New] In 2024, Snug Scenes for Snowy Screens  A Focused List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-set-up-grid-layout-for-google-meet-participants-viewing-for-2024/"><u>[New] Set Up Grid Layout for Google Meet Participants' Viewing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-navigating-the-future-of-fb-advertising-key-predictions/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Navigating the Future of FB Advertising – Key Predictions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-free-location-spoofers-to-fake-gps-location-on-your-infinix-smart-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Free Location Spoofers to Fake GPS Location on your Infinix Smart 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-androids-optimal-cloud-savers-updated-list/"><u>2024 Approved  Android's Optimal Cloud Savers Updated List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/accelerate-sluggish-windows-based-excel-processes/"><u>Accelerate Sluggish Windows-Based Excel Processes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/avoiding-the-pitfalls-of-mysterious-obs-studio-recordings/"><u>Avoiding the Pitfalls of Mysterious OBS Studio Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-for-xiaomi-14-ultra-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Complete Tutorial for Xiaomi 14 Ultra Hard Reset | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-xiaomi-redmi-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Xiaomi Redmi 12?

When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to create a circular path on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png"                      alt="try setting a circle route"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route"><a href="#Part-2-Realistic-Mode-For-One-Stop-Route-and-Multi-Stop-Route" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)"></a>Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)</h3><p>This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation.

Moreover, you can also activate the <strong>Auto jump after cooldown</strong> in the <strong>Jump teleport mode</strong> after turning on the Cooldown Timer.</p><p>This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.</p><h3 id="Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File"><a href="#Part-5-Import-Export-GPX-File" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File"></a>Part 5: Import&#x2F;Export GPX File</h3><p>You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files.

But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.</p><p>For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place.

You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.</p><ul><li>This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.</li><li>Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.</li><li>Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you.

Well! You can go for a spoofing app for this too. There are lots of them available at the Google Play Store. For more clarity, we will help you know how you can use a spoofer app for Life360 fake location. Make sure to go along with the steps carefully.</p><p>Before you get the app worked, here is a requirement you need to follow. The requirement simply says you to enable the developer options in your Vivo S17t. If you know how to do it, it’s good. But if you don’t here are the steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open “Settings” in the first place and tap on “System”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-1.jpg"                      alt="enable developer options"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, you need to go to the “About Phone” option. Followed by this, head to “Software info”.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will find the build number of your device here. You have to tap on it nearly 7 times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-2.jpg"                      alt="build number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, enter the lock code when asked and the developer options will be enabled.</p><h3 id="Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer"></a>Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Now that you have turned on the developer options, you can visit the Play Store and look for Fake GPS Location app. Install it on your phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, again go to “Settings” &gt; “System” &gt; “Developer Options”. Look for the “Select mock location app” and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/select-mock-location-app.jpg"                      alt="select mock location app from settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Fake GPS app as the mock location app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/select-app-android.jpg"                      alt="set Fake GPS app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the app now and choose the location you wish to fake and hit on the Play button.

This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.</p><ul><li>Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone&#x2F;Android.</li><li>Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.</li><li>There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.</p><h3 id="6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings"><a href="#6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings"></a>6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings</h3><p>Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> At the lower right corner, hit on “Settings”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg"                      alt="settings of Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hit on “Location Sharing”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg"                      alt="go to Location Sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying “Location Sharing Paused” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing for Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><ol><li><strong>How do I delete my history on Life360?</strong></li></ol><p>While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won’t suffice.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, it’s possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Vivo S17t device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?</strong></li></ol><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.</p><ol start="4"><li> <strong>If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?</strong></li></ol><p>Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device’s location services.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option. We discussed some helpful ways <strong>how to fake your location on Life360</strong> in this article, including <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which allows you to manipulate your GPS location, simulate routes, and set up geofences, making it a versatile solution for your location spoofing needs.
