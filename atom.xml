Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Tecno Spark 20C devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Tecno Spark 20C keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Tecno Spark 20C gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone"></a>Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone</h2><p>As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html" >Tecno Spark 20C S22 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen. Select the network that is causing trouble from that list and hit the ‘Forget Network’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-4.jpg"                      alt="click on forgot network"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: After that, you should reconnect to this Wi-Fi network by selecting it from the Wi-Fi list and entering its password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-5.jpg"                      alt="enter wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router"><a href="#Fix-4-Restart-Your-Router" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Restart Your Router"></a>Fix 4: Restart Your Router</h3><p>As we discussed, to restart your phone, you can also restart the router to get rid of the problem. For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Tecno Spark 20C device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg"                      alt="open wifi settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You will see a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you have connected to previously.

Check Recently Installed Applications"></a>Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications</h3><p>Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying.

This is more than just the loss of a device. A <strong>bricked cell phone</strong> also involves potential data erasure. Yet, it’s crucial to understand the true implications of a <strong>bricked phone</strong>. This page tackles how to address the issue of a bricked Android phone.</p><p>This comprehensive guide aims to the reasons behind Android phones becoming bricked. By reading below, you’ll learn effective methods to <strong>unbrick a mobile phone</strong> without the risk of data loss.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-restore-a-bricked-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="man holding a bricked phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Brick-Phones-At-a-Glance"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Brick-Phones-At-a-Glance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.</p><ul><li><strong>Soft Brick</strong>. A soft brick entails a phone that’s not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.</li><li><strong>Hard Brick</strong>.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.</li></ul><h3 id="The-Common-Causes-of-a-Cell-Phone-Bricking"><a href="#The-Common-Causes-of-a-Cell-Phone-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking"></a>The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking</h3><p>Below are the common causes why a <strong>cell phone bricks</strong>.</p><h4 id="Failed-Updates"><a href="#Failed-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Failed Updates"></a>Failed Updates</h4><p>When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a <strong>bricked phone</strong>. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone’s software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Honor X50 GT device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.</p><h4 id="Failed-Flashing"><a href="#Failed-Flashing" class="headerlink" title="Failed Flashing"></a>Failed Flashing</h4><p>Flashing involves <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html" >installing custom firmware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Honor X50 GT device’s hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device’s essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.</p><h4 id="Rooting"><a href="#Rooting" class="headerlink" title="Rooting"></a>Rooting</h4><p>Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device’s OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html" >Rooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone’s core functionality.</p><h4 id="Installing-Bad-Apps"><a href="#Installing-Bad-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Installing Bad Apps"></a>Installing Bad Apps</h4><p>Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation.

Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Unbricking-Methods-and-Tools"><a href="#Part-2-Unbricking-Methods-and-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Update the App</p><p>It is always advisable to keep your Android software as well as your Apps up-to-date and you must constantly check for any updates which may be available in the Google Play Store.</p><p>Follow the steps given below to update the app which won’t open on your phone:</p><p>• Visit Google Play Store on your Honor X50 GT.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583996008.jpg"                      alt="Visit Google Play Store"                ></p><p>• Now select “My Apps &amp; Games” from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183627979.jpg"                      alt="select “My Apps &amp; Games"                ></p><p>• In this step, you may click on “Update All” to update all Apps for which an update is available or manually select the Apps which you wish to Update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183782889.jpg"                      alt="Update All"                ></p><p>Once the App is updated, close all Apps and tabs running in the background. Now try to launch the app once again. If it opens, your problem is solved. If not, DO NOT worry as there are more ways to help you.</p><p>2. Force Stop the App</p><p>Closing the App completely which won’t open on your phone is a good idea. To make sure that no operations are running in the background related to the App, you must “Force Stop” it. Doing this is extremely simple and all you need to do is follow the steps given herein under:</p><p>• Visit “Settings” on your phone.</p><p>• Click on “Apps” to see a list of all the Apps on your Honor X50 GT.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184003158.jpg"                      alt="Click on “Apps”"                ></p><p>• Select the App which won’t open.</p><p>• Now click on “Force Stop” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184186018.jpg"                      alt="click on “Force Stop”"                ></p><p>3. Clear App Cache and Data</p><p>This method resolves the issue to a great extent by wiping off unnecessary App content from your device.</p><p>Carefully follow the step-by-step instructions given below to clear all App cache and data:</p><p>• Visit “Settings” and select “Apps”.</p><p>• From the list of Apps that appears, select the App that won’t open.</p><p>• Now tap on “Clear Cache” and “Clear data” directly or under “Storage”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984585184488.jpg"                      alt="Clear data"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-3-Common-fix-if-all-Apps-won’t-open-on-Android"><a href="#Part-4-3-Common-fix-if-all-Apps-won’t-open-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android"></a>Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android</h2><p>In this segment, we will discuss solutions to the problem if all your Apps won’t open. They are simple and easy to follow and solve the error in no time.</p><p>1. Android updates</p><p>Firstly, it is very important to keep your Android software updated at all times as an old Android version might not support new Apps or updated Apps.</p><p>To update your software:</p><p>• Visit “Settings” and keep going downwards.</p><p>• Now select “About Phone”.</p><p>• From the options available on the screen, tap on “System Updates”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184697337.jpg"                      alt="tap on “System Updates"                ></p><p>• In this step, if you are prompted for an update, follow the instruction given and do so.</p><p>Updating your Android software solves most of your problems.

Restart the phone</p><p>Restarting your Honor X50 GT to fix an error might sound old school but it gives good results when your Apps won’t open. Restarting your phone is fairly simple. All you need to do is:</p><p>• Long press the power button.</p><p>• Now click on “Restart”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184913200.jpg"                      alt="click on “Restart”"                ></p><p>Your phone will automatically restart and once it does, you can try to launch the App. You may also restart your Honor X50 GT by pressing the power button for about 15-20 seconds.</p><p>3. Reset Factory Settings</p><p>This method is a little tedious and must be last on your list.

It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.</p><p>A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home&#x2F;main screen of the Honor X50 GT device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Honor X50 GT device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Honor X50 GT device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn’t respond to any command, even the power on command.</p><p>If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.</p><p>Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?"></a>Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?</h2><p>To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.</p><p>A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error&#x2F;crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg" alt="hard bricked v/s soft bricked"></p><p>Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone. The techniques listed here are the best and the most efficient ways to get your phone back to its normal working conditions without losing your important data or damaging your device or its software.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop"></a>Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop</h2><p>This is the first sign of a soft bricked Android phone. Boot Loop is nothing but when your phone does not remain switched off and turns itself on automatically, and freezes at the logo screen or blank screen, every time you manually try to power it off.</p><p>Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions. These partitions are nothing but storage locations for your modem, kernels, system files, drivers and built-in Apps data.</p><p>It is advisable to clear Cache partitions regularly to keep your phone free from such glitches.</p><p>Since the phone refuses to boot, Cache can be cleared from entering into the Recovery Mode. Different Android devices have different ways to put it in recovery mode. Normally pressing the power key and volume down key helps, but you may refer to your phone’s guide for better understanding and then follow the steps given below to clear the cache partition:</p><p>Once you are the recovery mode screen, you will see a number of options as shown in the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987490613783.jpg"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p>Use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987491246838.jpg"                      alt="”Wipe cache partition”"                >&gt;</p><p>After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged up and unwanted files. You may loose some App related data, but that is a small price to pay to fix your bricked phone.</p><p>If this method does not boot up your brick smartphone and the problem still persists, there are two more things you can try. Read ahead to find out about them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode"><a href="#Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode"></a>Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode</h2><p>If your bricked phone does not boot up to your Home Screen or Lock screen and instead boots directly into Recovery Mode, there is not much left to do. Booting straight into recovery mode is undoubtedly a soft brick error but it also indicates a possible problem with your current ROM. The only option you have to flash a new ROM to reboot your bricked phone back to its normal functioning.</p><p>To flash a new ROM:</p><p>Firstly, you must root your phone and unlock the Bootloader. Every phone’s mechanism to unlock the bootloader is different, thus, we suggest to refer to your user manual.</p><p>Once the Bootloader is unlocked, take a backup of all your data by selecting “Backup” or “Android” back in recovery mode. The process should not take long and all you need to do is tap “OK” to config backup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191436732.jpg"                      alt="backup and restore"                ></p><p>In this step, download a ROM of your choice and store it in your SD Card. Insert the SD Card in your phone to begin the flashing process.</p><p>Once at the recovery mode, select “Install Zip from SD Card” from the options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191676749.jpg"                      alt="install zip from sdcard"                ></p><p>Scroll down using the volume key and use the power key to select the downloaded ROM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191926694.jpg"                      alt="Scroll down"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987192218478.jpg"                      alt="select the downloaded ROM"                ></p><p>This might take a few minutes of your time, but once the process is complete, reboot your phone.</p><p>Hopefully, your bricked phone will not boot normally and work smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader"><a href="#Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader"></a>Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader</h2><p>If your bricked phone boots straight into Bootloader, then this a serious issue and must not be taken lightly. Flashing a new ROM or clearing cache partitions are of little help in such a brick smartphone situation. Booting straight into Bootloader is a peculiar soft bricked Android phone feature and can be tackled only by downloading and flashing your original ROM from the manufacturer. In order to do so, a detailed study about your manufacturer’s ROM, ways to download and flash must be carried out. Since different Android phones come with different types of ROMs, it difficult to cover all the aspects about the different types of ROMs.</p><p>Brick smartphone problem has become more prominent than phone freezing or hanging issue. Android users are often seen looking for solutions to fix their soft brick and hard brick phones. Android phones are prone to get bricked and thus, it is important for us to know about the three techniques given above. These methods have been tried, tested and recommended by ay affected bricked phone users. Therefore, these tips are reliable and worth a try.

This is more than just the loss of a device. A <strong>bricked cell phone</strong> also involves potential data erasure. Yet, it’s crucial to understand the true implications of a <strong>bricked phone</strong>. This page tackles how to address the issue of a bricked Android phone.</p><p>This comprehensive guide aims to the reasons behind Android phones becoming bricked. By reading below, you’ll learn effective methods to <strong>unbrick a mobile phone</strong> without the risk of data loss.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-restore-a-bricked-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="man holding a bricked phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Brick-Phones-At-a-Glance"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Brick-Phones-At-a-Glance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.</p><ul><li><strong>Soft Brick</strong>. A soft brick entails a phone that’s not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.</li><li><strong>Hard Brick</strong>.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.</li></ul><h3 id="The-Common-Causes-of-a-Cell-Phone-Bricking"><a href="#The-Common-Causes-of-a-Cell-Phone-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking"></a>The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking</h3><p>Below are the common causes why a <strong>cell phone bricks</strong>.</p><h4 id="Failed-Updates"><a href="#Failed-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Failed Updates"></a>Failed Updates</h4><p>When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a <strong>bricked phone</strong>. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone’s software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Honor 90 device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.</p><h4 id="Failed-Flashing"><a href="#Failed-Flashing" class="headerlink" title="Failed Flashing"></a>Failed Flashing</h4><p>Flashing involves <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html" >installing custom firmware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Honor 90 device’s hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device’s essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.</p><h4 id="Rooting"><a href="#Rooting" class="headerlink" title="Rooting"></a>Rooting</h4><p>Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device’s OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html" >Rooting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone’s core functionality.</p><h4 id="Installing-Bad-Apps"><a href="#Installing-Bad-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Installing Bad Apps"></a>Installing Bad Apps</h4><p>Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation.

How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?"></a>Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?</h3><p>Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – <strong>Hulu home location</strong>. The home location will apply to all the Honor Magic 6 Lite devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.</p><p>Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.</p><p>So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg"                      alt="home location error"                ></p><p>To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you <strong>remove home location errors</strong>:</p><p><strong>Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router</strong></p><p>Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.</p><p><strong>Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer</strong></p><p>Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/images/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Fake-the-Location-to-Get-Around-the-MLB-Blackouts-on-Honor-Magic-6-Lite"><a href="#Fake-the-Location-to-Get-Around-the-MLB-Blackouts-on-Honor-Magic-6-Lite" class="headerlink" title="Fake the Location to Get Around the MLB Blackouts on Honor Magic 6 Lite"></a>Fake the Location to Get Around the MLB Blackouts on Honor Magic 6 Lite</h2><p>MLB games are the most awaited event for game enthusiasts.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reliable-User-Guide-to-Fix-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Running-Slow-and-Freezing"><a href="#Reliable-User-Guide-to-Fix-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Running-Slow-and-Freezing" class="headerlink" title="Reliable User Guide to Fix Samsung Galaxy S24+ Running Slow and Freezing"></a>Reliable User Guide to Fix Samsung Galaxy S24+ Running Slow and Freezing</h2><p>Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Samsung Galaxy S24+ contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Samsung Galaxy S24+ is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Samsung Galaxy S24+ is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Samsung Galaxy S24+ is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Samsung Galaxy S24+s.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Samsung Galaxy S24+ is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device. So if your Samsung Galaxy S24+ is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device’s animation type and speed on your Samsung Galaxy S24+ via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Samsung Galaxy S24+ to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Samsung Galaxy S24+ is running slow and freezing, the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues"></a>Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues</h3><p>Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Samsung Galaxy S24+ device’s overall performance is affected.

Also, choose Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="how to add location filter on Snapchat connect device"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> The Virtual Location map will launch immediately.

It’s that simple!</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-about-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-about-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs about Snapchat"></a>Part 4: FAQs about Snapchat</h2><h3 id="Q1-What-is-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Q1-What-is-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Q1: What is Ghost Mode on Snapchat?"></a>Q1: What is Ghost Mode on Snapchat?</h3><p>Snapchat comes with an inbuilt Snap Map introduced in 2017. Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!</p><h3 id="Q2-What-are-the-differences-between-Ghost-Mode-and-disabling-Location-Filters"><a href="#Q2-What-are-the-differences-between-Ghost-Mode-and-disabling-Location-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?"></a>Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?</h3><p>The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don’t have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.</p><h3 id="Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map"><a href="#Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map" class="headerlink" title="Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?"></a>Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?</h3><p>Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won’t update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.</p><h3 id="Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location"><a href="#Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?"></a>Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?</h3><p>While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone’s GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.</p><h3 id="Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?"></a>Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?</h3><p>Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile &gt; Settings &gt; See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you’ll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You’ll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can’t find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-Up"><a href="#Wrap-it-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it Up"></a>Wrap it Up</h3><p>Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post. But because you can’t spoof your location on Snapchat, I recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to teleport your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world. This tool also works with other social media apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram.

Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Spotify.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Settings</strong>in the upper right corner.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg"                      alt="settings in spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap <strong>Log Out</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg"                      alt="log out of spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Log In</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-6.jpg"                      alt="log into spotify"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter your login credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap <strong>Login</strong>again, and you’re in.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-7.jpg"                      alt="re-login to spotify with your credentials"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h3><p>Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-8.jpg"                      alt="restart android to fix spotify crashing"                ></p><h3 id="5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date"><a href="#5-Set-Up-Your-Time-and-Date" class="headerlink" title="5. Set Up Your Time and Date"></a>5. Set Up Your Time and Date</h3><p>Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>on your Android.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>System</strong>or <strong>General Management</strong> (depending on your Android model).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to <strong>Date and Time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Set Date</strong>and set the correct date.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-9.jpg"                      alt="set date on android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Go to <strong>Set Time</strong>and set the right time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg"                      alt="set time on android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Your-System-Software"><a href="#6-Update-Your-System-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Your System Software"></a>6. Update Your System Software</h3><p>Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated.

Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down.

However, unbricking is the crucial solution to regain the functionality of your Motorola Edge 40 Pro device.</p><p>This guide teaches effective methods to <strong>unbrick your Motorola Edge 40 Pro</strong>.

Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device</h2><p>When a phone “bricks,” the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a “brick.” A bricked Motorola Edge 40 Pro device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.</p><ul><li>**Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Motorola Edge 40 Pro freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.</li><li>**Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.</li><li>**Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.</li><li>**Unexpected Reboots and Crashes.**Frequent and unprovoked reboots, app crashes, and system instability might point toward software inconsistencies. Similar to consistent black screens, this could eventually lead to bricking.</li></ul><h3 id="Common-Reasons-for-Your-Motorola-Edge-40-Pro-Phone-To-Be-Bricked"><a href="#Common-Reasons-for-Your-Motorola-Edge-40-Pro-Phone-To-Be-Bricked" class="headerlink" title="Common Reasons for Your Motorola Edge 40 Pro Phone To Be Bricked"></a>Common Reasons for Your Motorola Edge 40 Pro Phone To Be Bricked</h3><p>Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Motorola Edge 40 Pro devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.</p><h4 id="Failed-Updates-or-Interrupted-Installations"><a href="#Failed-Updates-or-Interrupted-Installations" class="headerlink" title="Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations"></a>Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations</h4><p>When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.</p><h4 id="Unauthorized-User-Modifications"><a href="#Unauthorized-User-Modifications" class="headerlink" title="Unauthorized User Modifications"></a>Unauthorized User Modifications</h4><p>Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device’s software, paving the way for bricking.</p><h4 id="Incorrect-Bootloader-Unlocking"><a href="#Incorrect-Bootloader-Unlocking" class="headerlink" title="Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking"></a>Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking</h4><p>Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.</p><h4 id="Compatibility-Issues-With-Custom-Software"><a href="#Compatibility-Issues-With-Custom-Software" class="headerlink" title="Compatibility Issues With Custom Software"></a>Compatibility Issues With Custom Software</h4><p>Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device’s hardware or official software.

After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Motorola Edge 40 Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

Here’s how you can boot your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Power Off Your Device</strong></p><p>Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Safe Mode</strong></p><p>To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:</p><ul><li>For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device.

Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

Trust me - with the help of a Snapchat location spoofer, you can easily do it and that too without jailbreaking&#x2F;rooting your phone. In this post, I will share these tips to fake GPS for Snapchat like a pro!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Location-Feature-in-Snapchat-all-about"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Location-Feature-in-Snapchat-all-about" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?"></a>Part 1: What is the Location Feature in Snapchat all about?</h2><p>A while back, Snapchat has integrated the GPS feature, which means it can track your location in the background. Besides that, your friends on Snapchat can also access your real-time location if they want. To access this feature, you can just launch Snapchat and pinch out the home screen. Now, you can get a map-based interface, where you can check the location of your friends. You can also tap on their avatar to get more details about their location.</p><p>If the feature is enabled, then you can also share your location with others and even post it in your stories too.</p><h3 id="How-to-turn-it-off"><a href="#How-to-turn-it-off" class="headerlink" title="How to turn it off?"></a>How to turn it off?</h3><p>Well, to be honest, a lot of people don’t like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won’t be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-You-Might-Wish-to-Fake-Snapchat-Location"><a href="#Part-2-Why-You-Might-Wish-to-Fake-Snapchat-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why You Might Wish to Fake Snapchat Location?"></a>Part 2: Why You Might Wish to Fake Snapchat Location?</h2><p>Needless to say, if someone has our real-time location access, then they can easily track us. Therefore, if you are concerned about your security or privacy, but can’t turn the feature off, then you can use a Snapchat spoof hack. This will fake your location for the Snapchat map and no one would know your actual whereabouts.</p><p>Apart from security concerns, a lot of users would like to spoof location on Snapchat to trick their friends. You can just change your location to anywhere in the world and make your friends believe that you are visiting that place for fun.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Snapchat-Location-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreaking-it"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Snapchat-Location-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreaking-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Snapchat Location on iPhone without Jailbreaking it?"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Snapchat Location on iPhone without Jailbreaking it?</h2><p>Now when you know the different scenarios to spoof location on Snapchat, let’s get into some details. Ideally, you can implement a Snapchat fake location hack on both iOS and Android devices. If you own an iOS device, then you can take the assistance of a reliable application like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The application also lets us simulate our movement between different spots. This will let you spoof your location not only on Snapchat, but on other dating and gaming apps as well. Here’s how you can use this Snapchat location spoofer and change your location in seconds.</p><ul><li>Firstly, just install the application on your system and connect your Google Pixel Fold to it using a working cable. From the home of the Dr.Fone toolkit, launch the Virtual Location module.</li><li>Once your Google Pixel Fold is detected, you need to agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="click this button"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you can see your present location on the map-like interface of the application. To spoof location on Snapchat, go to the top-right corner, and click on the “Teleport Mode” option.</li><li>This will let you enter the name or the address of the target location in the search bar. You can also enter the exact coordinates of the place and load it on the interface.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><ul><li>In the end, you can just adjust the pin around or zoom in&#x2F;out the map as per your requirements.

Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn’t. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.</p><p>The in-built apps like ‘Camera’ use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg"                      alt="photo with date stamp"                ></p><p>Your ‘Reminder or Alarm’ apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you’ve reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg"                      alt="reminder app"                ></p><p>The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location apps"                ></p><p>Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in.

This is more than just the loss of a device. A <strong>bricked cell phone</strong> also involves potential data erasure. Yet, it’s crucial to understand the true implications of a <strong>bricked phone</strong>.

By reading below, you’ll learn effective methods to <strong>unbrick a mobile phone</strong> without the risk of data loss.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/how-to-restore-a-bricked-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="man holding a bricked phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Brick-Phones-At-a-Glance"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Brick-Phones-At-a-Glance" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.</p><ul><li><strong>Soft Brick</strong>. A soft brick entails a phone that’s not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.</li><li><strong>Hard Brick</strong>.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.</li></ul><h3 id="The-Common-Causes-of-a-Cell-Phone-Bricking"><a href="#The-Common-Causes-of-a-Cell-Phone-Bricking" class="headerlink" title="The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking"></a>The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking</h3><p>Below are the common causes why a <strong>cell phone bricks</strong>.</p><h4 id="Failed-Updates"><a href="#Failed-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Failed Updates"></a>Failed Updates</h4><p>When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a <strong>bricked phone</strong>.

However, Honor 90 stands as an exception in such case. And therefore, many times <strong><em>TouchWiz starts stopping</em></strong> right after upgrading. Thus, due to the collection of cache data, TouchWiz can display error. This calls for removing the cache from TouchWiz and run things smoothly. Here is how to do this:</p><ul><li>Tap on “Apps” from the Home screen firstly.</li><li>Launch “Settings” afterwards</li><li>Look for “Applications” and tap on it followed by “Application Manager”.</li><li>When Application Manager gets opened, swipe towards right to get into the “All” screen.</li><li>Now, choose “TouchWiz” and tap “Clear Cache”.</li><li>Now, tap “Clear Data” followed by “OK”.</li><li>Now restart your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-cache-touchwiz.jpg"                      alt="clear cache to fix touchwiz home stopping"                ></p><p>Please note that this will delete all your Home screens post this method.</p><h3 id="Disable-Motion-gesture-settings"><a href="#Disable-Motion-gesture-settings" class="headerlink" title="Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings"></a>Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings</h3><p>The functions regarding Motions and Gestures can be responsible for why <strong><em>TouchWiz home has stopped</em></strong> in your device. Usually the Honor 90 devices running on Android version less than Marshmallow are prone to encountering this issue. Or the Honor 90 devices having modest specs often fall prey to the issue. When you disable these settings, you might get out of the problem.</p><h3 id="Change-the-Animation-Scale"><a href="#Change-the-Animation-Scale" class="headerlink" title="Change the Animation Scale"></a>Change the Animation Scale</h3><p>When you use TouchWiz, it may consume higher memory usage for high amount of graphic maintenance. As a result, the “**<em>unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped</em>**” error might crop up. Taking this into consideration, you should try reconfiguring the animation scale and get rid of the error. Here’s how:</p><h3 id="Clear-Cache-Partition"><a href="#Clear-Cache-Partition" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cache Partition"></a>Clear Cache Partition</h3><p>In case the above steps didn’t figure out the problem, here is the next tip. This method can be counted as one of the most effective one. Because it is able to fix minor issues in Android devices, we recommend you for “**<em>TouchWiz home has stopped</em>**” issue too. Let us know how you can do it:</p><ul><li>Turn off your Honor 90 device.</li><li>Start pressing and holding “Volume Up” and “Power” buttons simultaneously.</li><li>Keep doing this until you see the Android screen. This will take your device into recovery mode.</li><li>You will observe some options on the screen. Take help of Volume buttons, scroll down to choose “Wipe Cache Partition”.

If unfortunately not, please try the following solution.</p><h3 id="Enable-the-easy-mode"><a href="#Enable-the-easy-mode" class="headerlink" title="Enable the easy mode"></a>Enable the easy mode</h3><p>For some users, enabling Easy Mode has been of great assistance. This feature aims to make the user experience more efficient by simply eliminating complex features. The Easy Mode removes those features that confuse the users by messing up the screen. Hence, we suggest you to switch to this mode in order to remove “**<em>TouchWiz not working</em>**” problem. The steps are:</p><ul><li>Open “Settings” and go to “Personalization”.</li><li>Hit on “Easy Mode” now.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/easy-mode.jpg"                      alt="easy mode to fix TouchWiz stopping"                ></p><p>Hope the <strong><em>TouchWiz won’t keep stopping</em></strong> error does not pop up anymore!</p><h3 id="Boot-your-phone-to-safe-mode"><a href="#Boot-your-phone-to-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Boot your phone to safe mode"></a>Boot your phone to safe mode</h3><p>Here is the next solution to be followed when TouchWiz keeps stopping. As we already said, third-party apps can cause this issue, booting your device in the Safe mode will disable those apps temporarily. Hence you need to boot your Honor 90 device to Safe mode and check if the reason is any third-party app.</p><ul><li>Switch off your device to initiate.</li><li>Press “Power” button and keep doing this until device’s logo appears on the screen.</li><li>When you see logo appearing, instantly release the button and start holding “Volume Down” button.</li><li>Keep holding until rebooting finishes.</li><li>You will now witness “Safe mode” on the bottom screen. You can now release the button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/enable-safe-mode.jpg"                      alt="safe mode"                ></p><h3 id="Reset-Factory-settings"><a href="#Reset-Factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Factory settings"></a>Reset Factory settings</h3><p>If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.</p><p>Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:</p><ul><li>Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup &amp; Reset”.</li><li>Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.</li><li>Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/reset-factory-settings.jpg"                      alt="reset factory settings"                ></p><ul><li>Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.</li></ul><h3 id="Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz"><a href="#Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz" class="headerlink" title="Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz"></a>Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz</h3><p>We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your <strong><em>TouchWiz is not working</em></strong>, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device.

Solving the internet issues"></a>1. Solving the internet issues</h3><p>Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.</p><p>If this is the cause of your <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong>, there isn’t much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to “Mapbox” to see if it addresses the problem.</p><h3 id="2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software"><a href="#2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4. Restarting Your Computer"></a>4. Restarting Your Computer</h3><p>Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="restart computer"                ></p><h3 id="5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked"><a href="#5-Verifying-the-network-connection-and-that-the-phone-is-unlocked" class="headerlink" title="5.

It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.</p><p>This article will share the possible reasons why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the boot screen</strong></strong>. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Motorola-Edge-40-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Motorola-Edge-40-Stuck-on-the-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Motorola Edge 40 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Motorola Edge 40 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Motorola Edge 40 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Motorola Edge 40 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Motorola Edge 40, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot. This simple yet effective solution could be what you need to solve all your Android problems. It is essential to leave your device turned off for at least a minute or two before turning it back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg"                      alt="forcing rebooting android device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Pull-Out-Battery"><a href="#2-Pull-Out-Battery" class="headerlink" title="2. Pull Out Battery"></a>2. Pull Out Battery</h3><p>Another way to restart your Motorola Edge 40 when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out. Android devices are designed with a removable battery, and sometimes you can resolve the issue easily by removing the battery and replacing it after a couple of seconds. Then, turn on your device again and test to see if your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page.</p><p>If it works, then the problem is solved. However, some Android devices come with a built-in battery. For these kinds of devices, a stimulated battery pull should be attempted. A simulated battery pull is a set of instructions telling your Motorola Edge 40 to switch off and on again. If your device does not offer the simulated battery pull option, omit this troubleshooting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-04.jpg"                      alt="removing battery on android device"                ></p><h3 id="3-Charge-Your-Device"><a href="#3-Charge-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Charge Your Device"></a>3. Charge Your Device</h3><p>If your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page and not getting past it, no matter how many times you have tried, it may be due to a low battery! As simple as it sounds, plug your device into a power outlet and try restarting your phone. You might be surprised that this simple fix is all it takes to solve your Android problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg"                      alt="charging android device"                ></p><h3 id="4-Wipe-Cache-Data"><a href="#4-Wipe-Cache-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Wipe Cache Data"></a>4. Wipe Cache Data</h3><p>Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Motorola Edge 40 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Motorola Edge 40 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Motorola Edge 40 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.</p><h3 id="5-Factory-Reset"><a href="#5-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="5. Factory Reset"></a>5. Factory Reset</h3><p>If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.</p><p>Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Motorola Edge 40:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-06.jpg"                      alt="factory reset of android phones"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-Best-App-To-Solve-Android-Phone-Stuck-On-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Bonus Tip: Best App To Solve Android Phone Stuck On Boot Screen"></a>Part 3.

The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Oppo Reno 11 5G device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Oppo Reno 11 5G device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Oppo Reno 11 5G device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Oppo Reno 11 5G contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Oppo Reno 11 5G device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Oppo Reno 11 5G device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Oppo-Reno-11-5G-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Oppo-Reno-11-5G-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Oppo Reno 11 5G is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Oppo Reno 11 5G is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Oppo Reno 11 5G is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users.

However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Oppo Reno 11 5G is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone.

Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Oppo Reno 11 5G device’s animation type and speed on your Oppo Reno 11 5G via the developer’s option.
