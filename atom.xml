However, it is a recent observation that many Vivo Y36 users complain about Vivo Y36 camera failed error while using the camera App on the Vivo Y36 device. It is a strange error and pops up suddenly with only one option to tap on, i.e., “OK”</p><p>The error message reads as follows: “Warning: Camera Failed”.</p><p>Once you click on “OK” the app shuts down abruptly and your Vivo Y36 camera is failed. We understand this is not a very pleasing situation, thus, here are ways to tackle the camera failed Vivo Y36 issue. Let us now move ahead and find out why exactly you experience Warning: Camera Failed error and how to fix it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vivo-Y36-phone-has-Warning-Camera-Failed-error"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vivo-Y36-phone-has-Warning-Camera-Failed-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Vivo Y36 phone has Warning: Camera Failed error?"></a>Part 1: Why Vivo Y36 phone has Warning: Camera Failed error?</h2><p>We are all aware that no device runs smoothly, without any glitches. We also know that there is a cause behind every problem.

Or possibly, it may freeze after getting opened thereby hampering the Vivo Y36 device’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/fix-unfortunately-settings-has-stopped.jpg"                      alt="unfortunately settings has stopped"                ></p><p>Well!

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Vivo Y36 and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”.

RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Vivo Y36 device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings.

It is very common to see a brick smartphone these days. If you are wondering what exactly is a bricked phone, here is your answer.</p><p>A bricked phone, hard brick or soft brick, is a smartphone which refuses to start or boot all the way up the home&#x2F;main screen of the Vivo Y28 5G device. This issue is observed within most Android phones because users have a tendency to tamper with the Vivo Y28 5G device settings, flashing new and customized ROMs and tweaking with the essential files. Playing around with the phone’s internal set-up leads to such errors, worst of them being a brick smartphone. Usually, a bricked phone does not switch on and stays frozen at the Vivo Y28 5G device logo, a blank screen or even worse, doesn’t respond to any command, even the power on command.</p><p>If you are confused about the soft brick and hard brick problems and looking for solutions to fix your priced phone, then here is all you need to know.</p><p>Read on to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-difference-between-soft-brick-and-hard-brick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?"></a>Part 1: What is the difference between soft brick and hard brick?</h2><p>To begin with, let us understand the basic difference between a soft brick and hard brick issue. Both versions of a bricked phone prevent it from booting but differ in their causes and gravity of the problem.</p><p>A soft-brick problem is caused merely by a software error&#x2F;crash and makes your device switch on automatically every time you manually turn it off. This phenomenon is referred to as Boot Loop. Soft bricked Android phones are not as difficult to fix as the hard bricked Android phones. It is convenient to say that a soft bricked phone only boots up half-way and not fully, whereas a hard bricked device does not switch on at all. A hard brick error is thus caused when the kernel, which is nothing but an interface for the software to communicate with the hardware, is tampered with. A hard bricked phone is not recognized by your PC when plugged in and is a serious problem. It requires troubleshooting techniques and cannot be easily fixed as the soft brick problem.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987188976168.jpeg" alt="hard bricked v/s soft bricked"></p><p>Hard bricked phones are a rare sight, but the soft brick is very common. Given below are ways to fix a soft brick Android phone. The techniques listed here are the best and the most efficient ways to get your phone back to its normal working conditions without losing your important data or damaging your device or its software.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-Stuck-at-the-Boot-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop"></a>Part 2: Stuck at the Boot Loop</h2><p>This is the first sign of a soft bricked Android phone. Boot Loop is nothing but when your phone does not remain switched off and turns itself on automatically, and freezes at the logo screen or blank screen, every time you manually try to power it off.</p><p>Stuck at boot loop problem can be fixed by clearing your Cache partitions. These partitions are nothing but storage locations for your modem, kernels, system files, drivers and built-in Apps data.</p><p>It is advisable to clear Cache partitions regularly to keep your phone free from such glitches.</p><p>Since the phone refuses to boot, Cache can be cleared from entering into the Recovery Mode. Different Android devices have different ways to put it in recovery mode. Normally pressing the power key and volume down key helps, but you may refer to your phone’s guide for better understanding and then follow the steps given below to clear the cache partition:</p><p>Once you are the recovery mode screen, you will see a number of options as shown in the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987490613783.jpg"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p>Use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987491246838.jpg"                      alt="”Wipe cache partition”"                >&gt;</p><p>After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged up and unwanted files. You may loose some App related data, but that is a small price to pay to fix your bricked phone.</p><p>If this method does not boot up your brick smartphone and the problem still persists, there are two more things you can try. Read ahead to find out about them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode"><a href="#Part-3-Booting-straight-into-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode"></a>Part 3: Booting straight into recovery mode</h2><p>If your bricked phone does not boot up to your Home Screen or Lock screen and instead boots directly into Recovery Mode, there is not much left to do. Booting straight into recovery mode is undoubtedly a soft brick error but it also indicates a possible problem with your current ROM. The only option you have to flash a new ROM to reboot your bricked phone back to its normal functioning.</p><p>To flash a new ROM:</p><p>Firstly, you must root your phone and unlock the Bootloader. Every phone’s mechanism to unlock the bootloader is different, thus, we suggest to refer to your user manual.</p><p>Once the Bootloader is unlocked, take a backup of all your data by selecting “Backup” or “Android” back in recovery mode. The process should not take long and all you need to do is tap “OK” to config backup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191436732.jpg"                      alt="backup and restore"                ></p><p>In this step, download a ROM of your choice and store it in your SD Card. Insert the SD Card in your phone to begin the flashing process.</p><p>Once at the recovery mode, select “Install Zip from SD Card” from the options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191676749.jpg"                      alt="install zip from sdcard"                ></p><p>Scroll down using the volume key and use the power key to select the downloaded ROM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987191926694.jpg"                      alt="Scroll down"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14987192218478.jpg"                      alt="select the downloaded ROM"                ></p><p>This might take a few minutes of your time, but once the process is complete, reboot your phone.</p><p>Hopefully, your bricked phone will not boot normally and work smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader"><a href="#Part-4-Booting-straight-into-Bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader"></a>Part 4: Booting straight into Bootloader</h2><p>If your bricked phone boots straight into Bootloader, then this a serious issue and must not be taken lightly.

We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Vivo Y27 5G device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Vivo Y27 5G device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Vivo Y27 5G device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Vivo Y27 5G contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Vivo Y27 5G device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Vivo Y27 5G device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Vivo-Y27-5G-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Vivo-Y27-5G-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Vivo Y27 5G is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Vivo Y27 5G is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Vivo Y27 5G is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users.

However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Vivo Y27 5G is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone.

Suddenly, you find yourself unable to browse the internet, send or receive emails, or stay connected through instant messages.</p><p>It’s a frustrating scenario, but let’s break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:</p><ol><li><strong>Enabling Airplane mode</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Why is My Vivo Y27 5G showing offline</strong>? Well, one common culprit behind the “offline” message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Vivo Y27 5G.

As well as, the records of the websites you previously enjoyed will also be lost.</p><h3 id="Check-browser-extensions-or-add-ons"><a href="#Check-browser-extensions-or-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Check browser extensions or add-ons"></a>Check browser extensions or add-ons</h3><p> If not the above one, try this tip. It encourages you to check your browser extensions. Perhaps these are interfering with the Gmail and due to this conflict, Gmail won’t load. You can either turn off these extensions and plug-ins temporarily or make use of the incognito mode of the browser where there are no such things like extensions and plug-ins.</p><h2 id="Problem-4-Gmail-can’t-send-or-receive"><a href="#Problem-4-Gmail-can’t-send-or-receive" class="headerlink" title="Problem 4: Gmail can’t send or receive"></a>Problem 4: Gmail can’t send or receive</h2><p>Gmail also gives you problem in sending or receive mails and messages. And to troubleshoot such issue, following are the solutions mentioned.</p><h3 id="Check-the-Latest-Version-of-Gmail"><a href="#Check-the-Latest-Version-of-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Check the Latest Version of Gmail"></a>Check the Latest Version of Gmail</h3><p>This issue is likely to emerge when you are using an outdated version of Gmail. And therefore, the first solution says you to check if the Gmail update is available. You can go to the Play Store and from the “My apps &amp; games” option, you can see if Gmail needs to be updated or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/check-update-gmail.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - check version"                ></p><h3 id="Verify-Internet-Connection"><a href="#Verify-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Verify Internet Connection"></a>Verify Internet Connection</h3><p>Another thing that carries weight while you can send or receive mails is the internet connection. As we all know that Gmail won’t respond if the Vivo Y200e 5G device is not connected to the internet. Therefore, you are advised to turn off Wi-Fi and then enable it again. Also, please ensure to switch to Wi-Fi if you are using the cellular data. This may hamper the process and stop you from receiving or sending mails.</p><h3 id="Remove-you-Account-and-Add-Again"><a href="#Remove-you-Account-and-Add-Again" class="headerlink" title="Remove you Account and Add Again"></a>Remove you Account and Add Again</h3><p>If still Gmail keeps stopping you to go ahead, make sure to once sign out from it. To do this:</p><ol><li><p>Open your Gmail app and go to “Manage accounts on this device”.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/remove-account-1.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - open gmail"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, tap on the account you are working with. Tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT” thereafter. After this, you can again sign in and then check if the problem is gone or not.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/remove-account-2.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - remove account"                ></p><h2 id="Problem-5-Stuck-in-sending"><a href="#Problem-5-Stuck-in-sending" class="headerlink" title="Problem 5: Stuck in sending"></a>Problem 5: Stuck in sending</h2><p>Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.</p><h3 id="Try-Alternative-Gmail-Address"><a href="#Try-Alternative-Gmail-Address" class="headerlink" title="Try Alternative Gmail Address"></a>Try Alternative Gmail Address</h3><p>First of all, if Gmail is not working due to stuck in sending issue, we advise you to make use of some other Gmail address to send the mail. If the problem still occurs, jump to the next solution.</p><h3 id="Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Check Network Connection"></a>Check Network Connection</h3><p>As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:</p><ol><li>Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.</li><li>Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.</li><li>Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.</li></ol><p>Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.</p><h3 id="Check-Attachments"><a href="#Check-Attachments" class="headerlink" title="Check Attachments"></a>Check Attachments</h3><p>Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.</p><h2 id="Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue"><a href="#Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue"></a>Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue</h2><p>Many times, the users get the error that says “Account not synced” while they try to work with Gmail. And this is the 6<sup>th</sup> problem we are introducing. The ways mentioned below will assist to get out of the trouble.</p><h3 id="Make-Space-in-the-Phone-1"><a href="#Make-Space-in-the-Phone-1" class="headerlink" title="Make Space in the Phone"></a>Make Space in the Phone</h3><p>When Gmail stops to further the process by prompting “Accounts not synced” issue, be sure that your Vivo Y200e 5G has some storage in it. If not, create it straight away. As we also mentioned in one of the above solutions, you can either delete the unnecessary files or transfer the important files to the PC to make the space in the phone. Go along with this tip and see if it works.</p><h3 id="Check-Gmail-Sync-Settings-1"><a href="#Check-Gmail-Sync-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Check Gmail Sync Settings"></a>Check Gmail Sync Settings</h3><p>As another solution, check Gmail sync settings to get the issue fixed.</p><ol><li><p>Simply open Gmail and hit the menu icon which is three horizontal lines on the top.</p></li><li><p>Go to “Settings” and choose your account.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="Gmail not responding - go to settings"                ></p></li><li><p>See the tiny box beside “Sync Gmail” and check it if it is not.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-2.jpg"                      alt="Gmail not responding - sync gmail"                ></p><h3 id="Restart-the-Vivo-Y200e-5G-device-2"><a href="#Restart-the-Vivo-Y200e-5G-device-2" class="headerlink" title="Restart the Vivo Y200e 5G device"></a>Restart the Vivo Y200e 5G device</h3><p>If the above method went futile, simply restart your device. Take help of the Power button on your device. Long press it and from the options, restart it. This will hopefully work for you.</p><h2 id="Problem-7-Gmail-app-running-slow"><a href="#Problem-7-Gmail-app-running-slow" class="headerlink" title="Problem 7: Gmail app running slow"></a>Problem 7: Gmail app running slow</h2><p>The last problem that you may face is the slow-going Gmail app. In simple words, you may experience that Gmail app is operating extremely slowly. To fix this, following solutions will help you.</p><h3 id="Restart-the-Phone"><a href="#Restart-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Restart the Phone"></a>Restart the Phone</h3><p>It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Vivo Y200e 5G in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.</p><h3 id="Clear-Storage-of-Device"><a href="#Clear-Storage-of-Device" class="headerlink" title="Clear Storage of Device"></a>Clear Storage of Device</h3><p>Usually all the apps start running slow when the Vivo Y200e 5G device is not having sufficient space. As the apps need space to function quickly and appropriately, having the Vivo Y200e 5G device on low storage can prove to be a bad luck for Gmail. So, make sure you wipe out the items you no longer needed on your device and create some room so that the Gmail responds nicely and won’t be running slow anymore.</p><h3 id="Update-Gmail-App"><a href="#Update-Gmail-App" class="headerlink" title="Update Gmail App"></a>Update Gmail App</h3><p>As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated. Therefore, go to Play Store and look for the Gmail update. If it is available, welcome it with smile and bid farewell to the problem of slow running Gmail.</p><p>What if your problem still doesn’t get resolved after following these 3 tips? Well!

Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to <strong>dial straight to voicemail</strong>. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:</p><p>Using the Settings app:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong>.</li></ul><p>Using the Quick Settings panel:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong> icon, then tap it to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode on"                ></p><ol start="8"><li>Check Blocked Numbers</li></ol><p><strong>“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone is calling.

To check this:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone dialer</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Block numbers</strong>.

Fortunately, there are several solutions you could try to fix it.</p><p>See what you can do if <strong>videos won’t play on your Android.</strong></p><h2 id="Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android"><a href="#Why-Are-My-Videos-Not-Playing-On-Android" class="headerlink" title="Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?"></a>Why Are My Videos Not Playing On Android?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-2.jpg"                      alt="person recording cityscape using their android"                ></p><p>Considering how most smartphone manufacturers tend to emphasize the unbelievable quality of their cameras, perfect night modes, seamless slow-motion recordings, superb resolution, and more, you’d expect all images and videos to function flawlessly on your Android. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case.</p><p>Occasionally, you could find that the videos you access from your gallery won’t play, sending you the message that “video cannot be played” or “can’t play video.” Other times, you might find that YouTube videos won’t load correctly or your downloaded videos won’t open in your media player.</p><p>There could be a wide variety of reasons that is happening, including:</p><ul><li>Corrupted video</li><li>Corrupted SD card</li><li>Outdated media player</li><li>Outdated OS</li><li>Incomplete download from the source</li><li>Low storage</li><li>Video downloaded from a suspicious source</li></ul><p>An array of hardware and software issues could lead to you being unable to play videos on your Android. However, that doesn’t mean you should immediately send your device for repairs or delete the videos that won’t play. There might be a few better solutions you could try.</p><h2 id="What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone"><a href="#What-You-Can-Do-if-Your-Videos-Aren’t-Playing-On-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone"></a>What You Can Do if Your Videos Aren’t Playing On Android Phone</h2><p>Since there are many reasons for having problems with videos not playing on your Android, you could also try many solutions.</p><h3 id="1-Do-a-Factory-Reset"><a href="#1-Do-a-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Factory Reset"></a>1. Do a Factory Reset</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-3.jpg"                      alt="person holding a black android"                ></p><p>While a factory reset shouldn’t always be the first solution you go to, it can usually prove to be the most effective one.</p><p>A factory reset, aka a master reset or a hard reset, returns all your software configurations to the original state when the phone was first manufactured. In the process, all your data is lost – any photos and videos you have on your phone and the apps you’ve installed will be deleted. You’ll be logged out of all your accounts and won’t have access to your message history, contacts, and more.</p><p>While it seems like an extreme step, it can help fix any video issues you might encounter due to software bugs.</p><p>Though there could be slight variations between different phones, you can usually perform a factory reset by going to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-4.jpg"                      alt="factory reset on android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Restart-Your-Vivo-Y200"><a href="#2-Restart-Your-Vivo-Y200" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart Your Vivo Y200"></a>2. Restart Your Vivo Y200</h3><p>While a factory reset is all but guaranteed to fix the issues you’re encountering with your videos, sometimes a simple restart might do the trick just fine. A restart works by clearing your RAM (Random Access Memory).</p><p>In a nutshell, RAM stores short-term data that helps your processor complete tasks quickly. This data is always easily accessible, and it’s what helps your phone quickly open webpages and apps you’ve recently used.</p><p>Over time, however, your RAM can get filled with unnecessary data and data fragments, which, in turn, can confuse your processor.</p><p>Restarting your phone will clear your RAM and potentially eliminate any data fragments causing your videos to be unplayable.</p><h3 id="3-Check-the-Video-Format"><a href="#3-Check-the-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Video Format"></a>3. Check the Video Format</h3><p>As a general rule of thumb, the videos you capture should be in a format your device supports. However, the videos you’ve downloaded might not be. That’s why checking the files’ video format before trying other possible fixes is in your best interest.</p><p>If the format isn’t supported, installing the right video player with the necessary compatibility is the most straightforward fix. Some of the most popular video players for Android include VLC for Android, GOM Player, MX Player, Bsplayer, and RealPlayer. You can easily find all of them in the Google Play Store.</p><h3 id="4-Check-the-Internet-Connection"><a href="#4-Check-the-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="4. Check the Internet Connection"></a>4. Check the Internet Connection</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-5.jpg"                      alt="pull-down bar on android showing wifi is turned off"                ></p><p>If you’re having problems playing downloaded or online videos, check your internet connection to see if there’s an issue there. If your internet’s down, any downloaded videos might not have downloaded correctly, and any online videos that haven’t been loaded will not play.</p><p>Make sure that you turn the Airplane mode off and your Wi-Fi on. Check the connection and test your internet speed to see if everything works properly.</p><p>You might need a network reset if your phone can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network. The path might differ between Android devices, but you should be able to find the option for a network reset at the exact location of your factory reset. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network settings &gt; Reset settings</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-6.jpg"                      alt="android network reset"                ></p><h3 id="5-Clear-the-Cache"><a href="#5-Clear-the-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Clear the Cache"></a>5. Clear the Cache</h3><p>The cache stores a copy of your most commonly used data, helping decrease loading time and improve your phone’s performance. However, too much cache data can take up too much space and cause data corruption, preventing you from accessing some of your apps.</p><p>On average, you should clear your phone’s cache every few months to ensure that everything runs smoothly. If you encounter issues with your videos not playing on Android, clearing the cache could be just the fix you need.</p><p>To clear the cache from your apps, you’ll want to go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps.</strong> From there, select the app you want to remove the cache from, scroll down to <strong>Storage</strong>, then choose <strong>Clear Cache</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-7.jpg"                      alt="clear cache on android apps"                ></p><h3 id="6-Update-Android-OS"><a href="#6-Update-Android-OS" class="headerlink" title="6. Update Android OS"></a>6. Update Android OS</h3><p>An outdated Android OS is usually the culprit behind many bugs and glitches you may encounter on your phone. It can prevent you from playing video files, accessing apps, taking photos, and more. It can lead to data corruption and loss, expose you to malware and cyberattacks, and compromise phone performance.</p><p>Regularly updating your OS to its latest version is always in your best interest. It can solve the problem of your videos not playing and protect you and your sensitive data.</p><h3 id="7-Repair-Your-Android-OS"><a href="#7-Repair-Your-Android-OS" class="headerlink" title="7. Repair Your Android OS"></a>7. Repair Your Android OS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/videos-not-playing-on-android-8.jpg"                      alt="person holding a phone with black screen"                ></p><p>You might already have the latest version of Android OS, but that still doesn’t mean your OS is functioning as it should. Maybe your phone was interrupted while downloading or installing the new OS version. Maybe your phone had underlying OS issues, or you accidentally downloaded files you shouldn’t have.

But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?</p><p>Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.</p><p>Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing <strong>Android WebView crash</strong>. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>App Freezing</strong></li></ul><p>One of the earliest signs of an <strong>Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G Android System WebView crash</strong> is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.</p><ul><li><strong>Unexpected App Closures</strong></li></ul><p>Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. <strong>Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G Android System WebView crashing apps</strong> can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.</p><ul><li><strong>Error Messages</strong></li></ul><p>Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash. These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg"                      alt="webview crash google app"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Slow Loading Times</strong></li></ul><p>Slow loading times can also be a sign of an impending crash. If webpages within the app take unusually long to load or images and other content appear pixelated or distorted, it could be a sign that Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G Android System WebView is struggling to handle the workload.</p><p>But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Updates and Compatibility Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Updates are often intended to improve software stability and compatibility, but in some cases, they can introduce new bugs or compatibility issues that lead to crashes. It is particularly evident when app developers and WebView developers release updates that don’t fully align, causing conflicts.</p><ul><li><strong>Insufficient Memory</strong></li></ul><p>Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G Android System WebView requires a certain amount of memory to operate properly.

For this, follow the steps below:</p><ol><li><p>Launch the Gmail app and tap on the menu icon (three horizontal lines).</p></li><li><p>Tap “Settings” and choose your account.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - find settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Check the box next to “Sync Gmail” if it’s not checked.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-2.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - sync gmail"                ></p><h3 id="Restart-the-Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-12T-Pro-device-1"><a href="#Restart-the-Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-12T-Pro-device-1" class="headerlink" title="Restart the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device"></a>Restart the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device</h3><p>Again, restarting can also be helpful in this situation. When you boot the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device again, check if your Gmail can sync or not.</p><h2 id="Problem-3-Gmail-won’t-load"><a href="#Problem-3-Gmail-won’t-load" class="headerlink" title="Problem 3: Gmail won’t load"></a>Problem 3: Gmail won’t load</h2><p>In case you are using the Gmail over your web browser and it has tested your patience in loading, here are the solutions that could prove to be fruitful for you. Please check these out.</p><h3 id="Ensure-to-Use-Gmail-Supported-Browser"><a href="#Ensure-to-Use-Gmail-Supported-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Ensure to Use Gmail Supported Browser"></a>Ensure to Use Gmail Supported Browser</h3><p>First of all, you need to make sure that the browser you are using works with Gmail or not. Gmail can smoothly perform in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. However, the browsers should be updated. So, please make sure that these browsers are running on the latest versions. Moreover, in case you use Chromebook, don’t forget to update the operating system in order to let it support Gmail.</p><h3 id="Clear-Cache-of-web-browser"><a href="#Clear-Cache-of-web-browser" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cache of web browser"></a>Clear Cache of web browser</h3><p>If you tried the above method but to no avail, try to clear the cache and cookies of the web browser. But by doing so, the browser history will be removed. As well as, the records of the websites you previously enjoyed will also be lost.</p><h3 id="Check-browser-extensions-or-add-ons"><a href="#Check-browser-extensions-or-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Check browser extensions or add-ons"></a>Check browser extensions or add-ons</h3><p> If not the above one, try this tip. It encourages you to check your browser extensions. Perhaps these are interfering with the Gmail and due to this conflict, Gmail won’t load. You can either turn off these extensions and plug-ins temporarily or make use of the incognito mode of the browser where there are no such things like extensions and plug-ins.</p><h2 id="Problem-4-Gmail-can’t-send-or-receive"><a href="#Problem-4-Gmail-can’t-send-or-receive" class="headerlink" title="Problem 4: Gmail can’t send or receive"></a>Problem 4: Gmail can’t send or receive</h2><p>Gmail also gives you problem in sending or receive mails and messages. And to troubleshoot such issue, following are the solutions mentioned.</p><h3 id="Check-the-Latest-Version-of-Gmail"><a href="#Check-the-Latest-Version-of-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Check the Latest Version of Gmail"></a>Check the Latest Version of Gmail</h3><p>This issue is likely to emerge when you are using an outdated version of Gmail. And therefore, the first solution says you to check if the Gmail update is available. You can go to the Play Store and from the “My apps &amp; games” option, you can see if Gmail needs to be updated or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/check-update-gmail.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - check version"                ></p><h3 id="Verify-Internet-Connection"><a href="#Verify-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Verify Internet Connection"></a>Verify Internet Connection</h3><p>Another thing that carries weight while you can send or receive mails is the internet connection. As we all know that Gmail won’t respond if the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device is not connected to the internet. Therefore, you are advised to turn off Wi-Fi and then enable it again. Also, please ensure to switch to Wi-Fi if you are using the cellular data. This may hamper the process and stop you from receiving or sending mails.</p><h3 id="Remove-you-Account-and-Add-Again"><a href="#Remove-you-Account-and-Add-Again" class="headerlink" title="Remove you Account and Add Again"></a>Remove you Account and Add Again</h3><p>If still Gmail keeps stopping you to go ahead, make sure to once sign out from it. To do this:</p><ol><li><p>Open your Gmail app and go to “Manage accounts on this device”.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/remove-account-1.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - open gmail"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, tap on the account you are working with. Tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT” thereafter. After this, you can again sign in and then check if the problem is gone or not.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/remove-account-2.jpg"                      alt="Gmail crashing on Android - remove account"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Problem-5-Stuck-in-sending"><a href="#Problem-5-Stuck-in-sending" class="headerlink" title="Problem 5: Stuck in sending"></a>Problem 5: Stuck in sending</h2><p>Now, here is another annoying problem that doesn’t let Gmail working on Android properly. This problem addresses the situation where users send a mail but it gets stuck on sending. If this is the problem that you are going through, the following solutions will help you.</p><h3 id="Try-Alternative-Gmail-Address"><a href="#Try-Alternative-Gmail-Address" class="headerlink" title="Try Alternative Gmail Address"></a>Try Alternative Gmail Address</h3><p>First of all, if Gmail is not working due to stuck in sending issue, we advise you to make use of some other Gmail address to send the mail. If the problem still occurs, jump to the next solution.</p><h3 id="Check-Network-Connection"><a href="#Check-Network-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Check Network Connection"></a>Check Network Connection</h3><p>As already mentioned, be sure of an active internet connection while working with Gmail. When you are not using a stable connection, it may lead to stuck on sending, Gmail crashing and many other issues. You can fix the issue by doing these three things:</p><ol><li>Most importantly, use only Wi-Fi rather than cellular data if you want a smoother process.</li><li>Turn off Wi-Fi and then turn it on again after nearly 5 seconds. Do the same with the router. Plug it out and the plug in.</li><li>Lastly, turn on Airplane mode and after a few seconds, turn it off again.</li></ol><p>Now try to send the mail and see if things are still the same or not.</p><h3 id="Check-Attachments"><a href="#Check-Attachments" class="headerlink" title="Check Attachments"></a>Check Attachments</h3><p>Large attachments can also be the reason for this issue. We would here like to suggest you to check the attachments you are sending. If these are not so important, you can remove them and send the mail. Or if it is not possible to send the mail without attachments, compressing the files can be a solution.</p><h2 id="Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue"><a href="#Problem-6-“Account-not-synced”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue"></a>Problem 6: “Account not synced” issue</h2><p>Many times, the users get the error that says “Account not synced” while they try to work with Gmail.

The ways mentioned below will assist to get out of the trouble.</p><h3 id="Make-Space-in-the-Phone-1"><a href="#Make-Space-in-the-Phone-1" class="headerlink" title="Make Space in the Phone"></a>Make Space in the Phone</h3><p>When Gmail stops to further the process by prompting “Accounts not synced” issue, be sure that your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro has some storage in it. If not, create it straight away. As we also mentioned in one of the above solutions, you can either delete the unnecessary files or transfer the important files to the PC to make the space in the phone. Go along with this tip and see if it works.</p><h3 id="Check-Gmail-Sync-Settings-1"><a href="#Check-Gmail-Sync-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Check Gmail Sync Settings"></a>Check Gmail Sync Settings</h3><p>As another solution, check Gmail sync settings to get the issue fixed.</p><ol><li><p>Simply open Gmail and hit the menu icon which is three horizontal lines on the top.</p></li><li><p>Go to “Settings” and choose your account.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="Gmail not responding - go to settings"                ></p></li><li><p>See the tiny box beside “Sync Gmail” and check it if it is not.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/gmail-sync-settings-2.jpg"                      alt="Gmail not responding - sync gmail"                ></p><h3 id="Restart-the-Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-12T-Pro-device-2"><a href="#Restart-the-Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-12T-Pro-device-2" class="headerlink" title="Restart the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device"></a>Restart the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device</h3><p>If the above method went futile, simply restart your device. Take help of the Power button on your device. Long press it and from the options, restart it. This will hopefully work for you.</p><h2 id="Problem-7-Gmail-app-running-slow"><a href="#Problem-7-Gmail-app-running-slow" class="headerlink" title="Problem 7: Gmail app running slow"></a>Problem 7: Gmail app running slow</h2><p>The last problem that you may face is the slow-going Gmail app. In simple words, you may experience that Gmail app is operating extremely slowly.

And here too, we would like you to restart your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.</p><h3 id="Clear-Storage-of-Device"><a href="#Clear-Storage-of-Device" class="headerlink" title="Clear Storage of Device"></a>Clear Storage of Device</h3><p>Usually all the apps start running slow when the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device is not having sufficient space. As the apps need space to function quickly and appropriately, having the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device on low storage can prove to be a bad luck for Gmail. So, make sure you wipe out the items you no longer needed on your device and create some room so that the Gmail responds nicely and won’t be running slow anymore.</p><h3 id="Update-Gmail-App"><a href="#Update-Gmail-App" class="headerlink" title="Update Gmail App"></a>Update Gmail App</h3><p>As the last tip that will indeed help you is to update the Gmail app. Until you update the app when required, Gmail keeps stopping you from working and you will definitely get frustrated.

Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail"></a>Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail</h2><p>If an incoming call to your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:</p><ol><li>Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</li></ol><p>DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the <strong>Do not disturb</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb mode not enabled"                ></p><p>Here’s an alternative way:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Do not disturb</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg"                      alt="notifications settings interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> offto disable the mode.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Turn Off Call Forwarding</li></ol><p>One reason calls go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong> is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app on your device, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg"                      alt="phone dial app settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call forwarding</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg"                      alt="call settings supplementary services"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>Disable Call Barring</li></ol><p>If a phone <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call barring</strong>, then tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Voice call</strong>, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls. When prompted, enter 0000 as a password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-06.jpg"                      alt="call barring settings interface"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Update Your Phone’s Software</li></ol><p>Sometimes, software bugs can cause problems with incoming calls, which may be why your last incoming <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>. If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.</p><p>To check for updates, open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Software update</strong> or <strong>System update</strong>. For a seamless update experience, follow the step-by-step instructions on your mobile screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-07.jpg"                      alt="software update settings"                ></p><ol start="5"><li>Reset Network Settings</li></ol><p>If the incoming calls on your <strong>phone go straight to voicemail</strong>, consider resetting your phone’s network settings. Network settings control how your phone connects to the cellular network. If these settings are not set up correctly, incoming calls may not be able to reach your device.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Resetting your network settings will erase any saved Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth pairings, requiring you to re-enter them after the reset is complete.</p><p>To reset your network settings on most Android devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your smartphone, then tap <strong>System</strong> or <strong>General Management</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> and confirm the action.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-08.jpg"                      alt="phone reset network settings"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>Turn Off Bluetooth</li></ol><p>When Bluetooth is on, it can interfere with your device’s ability to receive calls, causing them to go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong>. To turn off <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-16/fix-wifi-bluetooth-issues-after-upgrading-ios-16.html"><u> Bluetooth</u></a> on an Android device, you can do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settingspanel, then tap the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> icon to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-09.jpg"                      alt="bluetooth not enabled"                ></p><ul><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Connections</strong> &gt; <strong>Bluetooth</strong> and toggle the switch off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-10.jpg"                      alt="turn off bluetooth on settings app"                ></p><p>It should help ensure that calls come through to your phone instead of going to voicemail.</p><ol start="7"><li>Check Airplane Mode</li></ol><p>If turning off Bluetooth didn’t solve the issue, another possible cause could be that your phone is in Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to <strong>dial straight to voicemail</strong>. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:</p><p>Using the Settings app:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong>.</li></ul><p>Using the Quick Settings panel:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong> icon, then tap it to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode on"                ></p><ol start="8"><li>Check Blocked Numbers</li></ol><p><strong>“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”</p><p>Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone dialer</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Block numbers</strong>. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg"                      alt="block numbers on the phone"                ></p><p>If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number. If your call didn’t go through, you know that he hasn’t blocked your number and that there may be another issue with his phone.</p><ol start="9"><li>Turn Off Google One VPN</li></ol><p>If you’re using Google One VPN, try turning it off to see if that fixes the problem. Some users have reported that Google One VPN can cause incoming calls to a <strong>phone to go straight to voicemail</strong>. To turn off Google One VPN:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Google One</strong> app on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> At the bottom, go to the <strong>Benefits</strong> tab, then tap <strong>View Details</strong> below the <strong>Online protection with a VPN</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg"                      alt="google one app interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Enable VPN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg"                      alt="turn off google one vpn"                ></p><ol start="10"><li>Contact Your Carrier</li></ol><p>If your <strong>phone calls go straight to voicemail</strong> after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.</p><p>And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself. You may need to try resetting your phone to factory settings or taking it to a repair shop.</p><ol start="11"><li>The Caller Used Ringless Voicemail</li></ol><p>Ringless voicemail is a service that allows businesses to bypass your phone’s ringtone and send you pre-recorded messages directly to voicemail.
