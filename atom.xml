The steps may vary slightly depending on the Realme 12 Pro 5G device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the <strong>Power button</strong>(you must press and hold both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> buttons on a newer Android device).</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Restart</strong>.

This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a <strong>touchscreen problem</strong> on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg"                      alt="android restart method"                ></p><p>To restart your Android, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the <strong>Power</strong> button as well as the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button at the same time.</p><h3 id="Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-5-Factory-Data-Reset-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android"></a>Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android</h3><p>Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Backup and Reset.</strong> Next, tap on <strong>Factory data reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete all</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg"                      alt="android factory data reset"                ></p><p>Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.</p><h3 id="Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Method-6-Put-Your-Android-into-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode"></a>Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode</h3><p>If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Placing your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Realme V30T.</p><p><strong>Step 1A</strong>: Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button and <strong>Volume Down</strong> buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1B</strong>: If your Realme V30T still has a <strong>Home</strong> button, press and hold the <strong>Home</strong> button and the <strong>Power</strong> button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1C</strong>: If step 1A did not put your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the <strong>Volume</strong> buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset, and confirm your choice with the <strong>Power</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 02"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for the process to complete and for your Realme V30T to restart automatically.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen"><a href="#Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen"></a>Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen</h3><p>If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the <strong>touchscreen problem,</strong> it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Realme V30T checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg"                      alt="图像"                >“</p><h3 id="Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center"><a href="#Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center" class="headerlink" title="Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center"></a>Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center</h3><p>Your <strong>phone touch problem</strong> might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Fix-Android-Touch-Problem-With-an-Alternative"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Fix-Android-Touch-Problem-With-an-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Fix Android Touch Problem With an Alternative"></a>Part 3: How To Fix Android Touch Problem With an Alternative</h2><p>If all the general <strong>phone touch problems</strong> on your Realme V30T persist, you should strongly consider <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-repair/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> to do the job.

Does a Cracked Screen Affect Touch on an Android?</h3><p>If you continue using a smartphone with a cracked screen, there are several implications. Your device will be vulnerable to further damage and might develop <strong>touchscreen problems</strong>,and your sensors will gradually begin to malfunction. The capabilities of your device are also compromised the longer you delay repairing it. Moreover, a cracked screen can put your fingers at risk of injury due to potential glass splinters.</p><h3 id="2-How-Do-I-Temporarily-Fix-a-Cracked-Screen"><a href="#2-How-Do-I-Temporarily-Fix-a-Cracked-Screen" class="headerlink" title="2.

How Do I Temporarily Fix a Cracked Screen?</h3><p>If you can’t take your cracked screen to a repair shop, apply a small amount of vegetable oil or petroleum jelly to the screen. Doing this will not fix the issue but will make the cracks less noticeable. On the other hand, you can also apply a screen protector to safeguard your phone against further damage. The screen protector slows down or prevents the cracks from getting worse.</p><h3 id="3-Can-I-Use-Dr-Fone-for-Free"><a href="#3-Can-I-Use-Dr-Fone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Canon PowerShot SX530 is a small, 16 megapixel digital camera with a very powerful zoom lens. Its small, lightweight, DSLR-like body makes it suitable for things like travel, hiking, and vacations. With a similar resolution to many newer<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >mobile phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we explored whether or not this camera is really worth keeping in your travel bag.</p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-mini-DSLR"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-mini-DSLR" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a mini DSLR"></a><strong>Design: Looks like a mini DSLR</strong></h2><p> At 15.59 oz, the Canon PowerShot SX530 weighs in at just under a pound and measures 4.7 x 3.2 x 3.6 inches. This makes it remarkably light for a DSLR-like camera in this class. The SX530 isn’t a true DSLR but borrows design elements from<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-new-canon-cameras-493499" >Canon’s other DSLR cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Its shape and user interface layout are very similar to Canon’s EOS Rebel series.</p><p> On the top of the camera you will find Canon’s traditional mode selection dial but with fewer options than a DSLR like the EOS Rebel T7. The SX530 includes modes like Auto, Scene, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Program, Manual, and even a Fish-Eye. Instead of a power switch, there is a power button right next to the mode dial.</p><p> On the left are two framing assist buttons used for the seek and lock functions. With these you can easily reacquire subjects and compose shots after manual zooming.</p><p> Several other function buttons are located to the right of the 3-inch LCD screen on the back of the camera. They are big enough to easily use but unlike EOS Rebel cameras, the SX530 has a center function and set button surrounded by a circular four-way button. Without the space between the center button and the outer controls we found ourselves accidentally hitting multiple buttons at once.</p><p> At 16 megapixels it’s similar to flagship mobile phones like the Samsung Note10.</p><p> The DSLR-like body is nice because it has an extremely comfortable grip. Being so compact also means that controls on the right side are really easy to reach with one hand. Though the lightweight plastic body doesn’t feel very sturdy, the camera feels really good in our hands and would be great on a longer trip when you don’t want a lot of weight in your travel bag or around your shoulders.</p><p> Overall, we loved the way this camera feels and found the design well suited to easy and intuitive use. The grip was even more comfortable than the Canon EOS Rebel T7 and the extremely powerful zoom lens let us take photos we couldn’t with the other lenses we have kicking around. Canon did a good job designing a compact, lightweight camera that looks more expensive than it actually is.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043639/7443" target="_top" id="2043639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043639/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Couldn’t-be-easier"><a href="#Setup-Process-Couldn’t-be-easier" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Couldn’t be easier"></a><strong>Setup Process: Couldn’t be easier</strong></h2><p> We found the setup process for the Canon PowerShot SX530 incredibly intuitive and easy. We popped the battery in, powered it up, set the date and time, and were ready to go in minutes. The SX530 is designed to be friendly to beginners and novices. This is the kind of camera that would make a great gift for mom or dad.</p><p> We played around with the options on the mode selection dial and found they all worked well. Auto mode will probably be most people’s go-to because this camera isn’t marketed to professionals who like delve deep into settings and image manipulation, but there is a manual mode. This is really a point and shoot camera at heart, and it does a great job being as comfortable as possible for new or casual photographers.</p><p> Canon’s user manual is great and we found everything was laid out in simple-to-understand terms, with plenty of diagrams so you can identify what all the buttons do. The camera has some handy settings that aren’t on by default, and we chose to add a grid layout to the LCD display to make photo composition easier. We also found the LCD’s default brightness to be a little dark, so we turned it up a bit and were happy with the results.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Decent-with-a-great-zoom"><a href="#Image-Quality-Decent-with-a-great-zoom" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Decent with a great zoom"></a><strong>Image Quality: Decent with a great zoom</strong></h2><p> The Canon PowerShot SX530 doesn’t have a very powerful image processor and sensor. At 16 megapixels it’s similar to flagship mobile phones like the Samsung Note10. We weren’t super impressed by the SX530’s image quality but it does perform better in low-light situations, and no smartphone is going to have the powerful zoom capabilities that the SX530 has.</p><p> The SX530 shoots Full HD 1080p video at 30 frames per second, falling behind some of its competitors that can go up to 60 fps. We only noticed minor stuttering while we were panning across a scene, though, and when stationary the image was smooth and colorful.</p><p> Where the camera really shines is it’s 24-1200mm equivalent zoom range, placing it in the “superzoom” category. The lens is very wide, so you can get big landscape shots, and it’s powerful enough to capture detail from far away. The image stabilization was pretty good, making the super up close photos possible by helping to steady the shot. At the maximum edge of the zoom, however, you really need a tripod to get reliable quality.</p><p> The aperture ranges from f&#x2F;3.4 to f&#x2F;6.5, which is pretty limited but similar to a lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ultra-zoom-cameras-493676" >other superzoom cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This makes it difficult to set a shallow depth of field and does limit some low-light situations. The built-in flash was surprisingly good though and didn’t overpower the photos we took. We found indoor photos of our friends and family came out well.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><h2 id="Features-Powerful-image-stabilization"><a href="#Features-Powerful-image-stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Features: Powerful image stabilization"></a><strong>Features: Powerful image stabilization</strong></h2><p> Besides its powerful 50x optical zoom lens, the Canon PowerShot SX530 has Intelligent IS optical image stabilization technology. The camera analyzes the image and its own movement and then applies the best correction method for whatever you are shooting. When taking still images the camera offers Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid), and Tripod stabilization modes. When recording video the Dynamic, Powered, Macro (Hyrbid), and Active Tripod modes help to steady whatever you are shooting.</p><p> The SX530 also offers both Wi-Fi and NFC sharing features. With Wi-Fi you can get your images off the camera and onto your Android or iOS device using Canon’s mobile app called Camera Connect. You can also use your mobile device as a remote control for the camera. You can change settings and trigger both photos and video recording. The NFC radio capabilities allow Android users to connect to the camera quickly and easily by tapping the two devices together. The camera has a dedicated button used to connect to your compatible devices with just one touch, which we found to be a really nice feature.</p><h2 id="Software-Auto-modes-done-right"><a href="#Software-Auto-modes-done-right" class="headerlink" title="Software: Auto modes done right"></a><strong>Software: Auto modes done right</strong></h2><p> The Canon PowerShot SX530 runs on Canon’s own software and although it’s not very feature rich, it’s easy to navigate and has everything a casual user would need. It’s worth reading through the manual to become familiar with all the modes and image stabilization options the camera has. Just looking through the menu options didn’t give us enough information to understand what everything did without the manual.</p><p> Canon itself has some alternatives in that price range with very similar specs, and even some that outperform the SX530.</p><p> The software allows for Hybrid Auto capture that records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a photo. Smart Auto detects the type of photo you are shooting, analyzing both your subject and the background, then automatically chooses the best settings. There are many additional shooting modes for situations ranging from simple portraits to more creative filters like fisheye, toy camera, and monochrome effects. It even has settings for shooting snow scenes and fireworks.</p><h2 id="Price-There-are-better-options"><a href="#Price-There-are-better-options" class="headerlink" title="Price: There are better options"></a><strong>Price: There are better options</strong></h2><p> The Canon PowerShot SX530 is $300 (MSRP) and has a common street price around $250. This puts it into a lower price range than many other compact DSLR-like alternatives. Canon itself has some alternatives in that price range with very similar specs, and even some that outperform the SX530.</p><p> The SX530 was a great value for the price but the technology is dated. Unfortunately, Canon’s newest model the PowerShot SX70 is currently around $550, which is a big jump in price. Modern superzoom cameras like the Panasonic Lumix FZ80, on the other hand, boast significantly better specs at nearly the same price as the SX530. Sony and Nikon both have several options worth looking at as well. Although the SX530 is a good camera at a decent value, it’s age is showing and definitely leaves it lagging behind current competitors.</p><h2 id="Canon-PowerShot-SX530-vs-Panasonic-Lumix-FZ80"><a href="#Canon-PowerShot-SX530-vs-Panasonic-Lumix-FZ80" class="headerlink" title="Canon PowerShot SX530 vs. Panasonic Lumix FZ80"></a><strong>Canon PowerShot SX530 vs. Panasonic Lumix FZ80</strong></h2><p> While the Panasonic Lumix FZ80 has a MSRP of $400, it generally runs around $300, the MSRP of the Canon PowerShot SX530’s and only $50 more than its street value.</p><p> The Lumix FZ80 is an 18.1 megapixel camera that shoots 4K photos with a 60x optical zoom. The camera has a f&#x2F;2.8 - f&#x2F;5.9 aperture range, a touch enabled LCD, Wi-Fi, and is even capable of shooting 4K video. It’s DC VARIO 20-1220mm lens is more powerful than the SX530 and has better low light performance. All of that is packed into a similar compact DSLR-like body.</p><p> The Lumix Fz80 is a clear winner here, a great value for the money and several steps above the Canon PowerShot SX530.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/panasonic-lumix-dc-fz80-review-4691071" >Panasonic Lumix DC-FZ80 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A great but outdated camera.</strong></p><p> The Canon PowerShot SX530 was a great little camera in its heyday, but in the contemporary market it’s not the best option for the price. The Panasonic Lumix FZ80 is a much better option and we know there’s plenty of other competition out there. If you can score the SX530 used for a great price go ahead and pull the trigger. At its current street price though, do yourself a favor and get something newer and more powerful.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nikon-coolpix-p1000-review-4691097" >Nikon COOLPIX P1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-sx70-hs-review-4691077" >Canon PowerShot SX70 HS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/canon-powershot-elph-190-review-4589522" >Canon PowerShot ELPH 190 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  PowerShot SX530 HS Bundle</li><li>Product Brand  Canon</li><li>SKU  SX530 HS</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Weight  15.6 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  4.7 x 3.2 x 3.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Warranty  1 Year</li><li>Sensor Type  CMOS</li><li>Megapixels  16.0 Megapixel</li><li>Sensor Size  28.0735mm2 (6.17mm x 4.55mm)</li><li>Aspect Ratio  4:3</li><li>Image Resolution  4608 x 3456 (15.9 MP, 4:3), 4608 x 3072 (14.2 MP, 3:2), 4608 x 2592 (11.9 MP, 16:9), 3456 x 3456 (11.9 MP, 1:1), 3264 x 2448 (8.0 MP, 4:3), 3264 x 2176 (7.1 MP, 3:2), 3264 x 1832 (6.0 MP, 16:9), 2448 x 2448 (6.0 MP, 1:1), 2048 x 1536 (3.1 MP, 4:3), 2048 x 1368 (2.8 MP, 3:2), 1920 x 1080 (2.1 MP, 16:9), 1536 x 1536 (2.4 MP, 1:1), 640 x 480 (0.3 MP, 4:3), 640 x 424 (0.3 MP, Other), 640 x 360 (0.2 MP, 16:9), 480 x 480 (0.2 MP, 1:1), 2304 x 1728 (4.0 MP, 4:3)</li><li>Video Resolution  1920x1080 (30p),1280x720 (30p), 640x480 (30p)</li><li>Media Format  JPEG (EXIF 2.3), MP4 (Image: MPEG-4 AVC&#x2F;H.264;</li><li>Memory Types  SD &#x2F;

Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>.

Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Tecno Spark 10 4G device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Tecno Spark 10 4G device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Tecno Spark 10 4G or tablet?

Or the internet service is lagging? We have a few options from which you can inspect your problem. Not all internet issues arise from the service provider, as some issues are because of the Samsung Galaxy A05 devices that are using the internet. Some of these issues are discussed below for your assistance:</p><ul><li><strong>Router Problems</strong></li></ul><p>If the internet provider is doing their job right, the router might not deliver you the right thing. Like other electronic devices, they can also misbehave. This can happen because the router is faulty, or it can happen because the firmware is outdated.</p><ul><li><strong>Out of Wi-Fi Range</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Why does My Samsung Galaxy A05 keep disconnecting from Wi-Fi</strong>? It is because you might be out of range! The router’s placement is very important. The router transmits frequencies that have a limited range. If you are moving out of the range, the internet automatically disconnects.</p><ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi Signals Getting Blocked</strong></li></ul><p>The signals from the router can dissipate from any other electronic device nearby. Signals like radio and microwaves can interfere with signal strength.</p><ul><li><strong>Devices Connected with Router</strong></li></ul><p>Commonly, a house has around a dozen devices connected to the internet router. People do not think that the router has limited connection slots. It is unable to entertain a specific number of requests for service facilitation. The router has limitations; the service quality will drop if the limitations are exceeded. This drop in quality can also cause internet disconnection from devices.</p><ul><li><strong>Unstable Internet</strong></li></ul><p>If your Samsung Galaxy A05 gets disconnected frequently, then this disconnection is due to unstable internet, but apart from the above-mentioned problems, there is another reason for internet disconnection.</p><p>Sometimes, the internet is stable, but it still disconnects. This is because the internet service provider might not send the best quality internet you have acquired it for. If your internet is stable and the phone still keeps disconnecting, then head onto the next part that will share the top 10 fixes to sort out this issue.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-10-Ways-to-Fix-Wi-Fi-Keep-Disconnecting-on-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone"></a>Part 2: 10 Ways to Fix Wi-Fi Keep Disconnecting on Phone</h2><p>As we have mentioned earlier if your Wi-Fi is stable, but it keeps disconnecting from <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s22.html" >Samsung Galaxy A05 S22 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other Android phones, the coming section of this article is for you.

Now, press the Power button and hold it for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, select the ‘Reboot’ option to resolve the issue from the options on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="select reboot option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-Router-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check Router Settings"></a>Fix 2: Check Router Settings</h3><p>If your Android keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi, you can also fix the problem by checking the router settings.

This could be done easily by following the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First, you need to open the Wi-Fi settings menu. This could be done by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu of your phone until the settings open up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on your wifi option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: A list of all the Wi-Fi networks will appear on the screen.

For this, hit the restart button on the router to get a fresh start. If the Samsung Galaxy A05 device has no button, disconnect the power supply and plug it back in to connect again. Most internet issues are resolved by restarting the router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-6.jpg"                      alt="restart wifi router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134248/18498" target="_top" id="2134248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134248/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks"><a href="#Fix-5-Forget-Old-Networks" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Forget Old Networks"></a>Fix 5: Forget Old Networks</h3><p>The problem that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting can also occur because of the list of networks you have connected to. Having yourselves connected to different set of networks could turn out to be quite problematic in the process. In the process of finding and switching to the best network, your device’s Wi-Fi will continually disconnect and reconnect with the nearby networks. To finish this irritating issue, you should remove and forget all the extra networks that you connected previously.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: You should start by pressing and holding the Wi-Fi option from the drop-down menu on your phone until the Wi-Fi settings screen appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-7.jpg"                      alt="open wifi settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You will see a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you have connected to previously. One by one, select each network and hit the ‘Forget Network’ button to remove it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-8.jpg"                      alt="forgot unnecessary wifi connections"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-6-Check-Recently-Installed-Applications"><a href="#Fix-6-Check-Recently-Installed-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications"></a>Fix 6. Check Recently Installed Applications</h3><p>Sometimes, different installed applications can also cause trouble. If your Wi-Fi was fine, but suddenly it started disconnecting, then don’t forget to check the recently installed apps. This is because with not knowing the damage it can cause, you might have installed some VPNs, connections boosters, or firewalls. You can try and disable them but if that doesn’t resolve the problem, then uninstall the app.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: For uninstalling the problematic application, you have to select it and hold it. You will see a pop-up menu of multiple options; choose the option of ‘Uninstall’ to remove the app from the phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wifi-9.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall button"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>It’s annoying that your Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting while you are working or studying.

What you need to do is clear the cache and clear the data of the play store. This will get rid of the error code 920 the next time you download or update any application from the Google Play store.</p><p>Step 1 – Go to settings of your device.</p><p>Step 2 – Now find “Applications” option under the settings menu.

When in Safe Mode, the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won’t run. Here’s how you can boot your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Power Off Your Device</strong></p><p>Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Safe Mode</strong></p><p>To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:</p><ul><li>For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer’s logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device finishes booting. You should see “Safe Mode” displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.</li><li>Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

Before you redirect to a proper solution for repairing your Xiaomi 14 Pro system, you can try restarting your device as a quick remedy. Restart the Android device to clear temporary system data and potentially resolve any software glitches causing the crash, which can be done as follows:</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Hold your Xiaomi 14 Pro’s “Power” button on the side of the phone. As the following window appears on the screen, select the “Reboot” option to restart the Android device successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-1.jpg"                      alt="restart the android device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Shut-down-unnecessary-running-apps"><a href="#Part-4-Shut-down-unnecessary-running-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Shut down unnecessary running apps"></a>Part 4: Shut down unnecessary running apps</h2><p>Another quick solution to avoid Android devices crashing is to shut down unnecessary apps running in the Xiaomi 14 Pro device’s background. To cater to that, you need to try out the following steps as a remedy to shutting down unwanted applications:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the “Settings” of your Xiaomi 14 Pro and continue to the “Battery and device care” section from the available options. Continue to the “Memory” section on the next window to lead to the applications taking up space on your Xiaomi 14 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on battery and device care"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you progress further, you need to select the “Clean now” button to shut down all unnecessary background applications running on the Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-3.jpg"                      alt="press the clean now button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Uninstall-incompatible-Apps-to-fix-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-5-Uninstall-incompatible-Apps-to-fix-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Uninstall incompatible Apps to fix Android crash issue"></a>Part 5: Uninstall incompatible Apps to fix Android crash issue</h2><p>If your Android system crash takes place frequently but the Xiaomi 14 Pro device turns on normally after that, there is a chance that some Apps may be causing the problem. Unnecessary and large App files burden the Xiaomi 14 Pro device system and force it to crash every now and then. Make sure you download, install and store only those Apps which are fully compatible with your Android system. DO NOT download Apps from other unknown sources and use only Google Play store for the purpose. All other incompatible Apps must be deleted to prevent them from tweaking your software.</p><p>To uninstall unwanted and incompatible Apps, please follow the steps below.</p><p>1. Visit “Settings” and search for “Application Manager” or “Apps”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988991424495.jpg"                      alt="application manager"                ></p><p>Select the App you wish to uninstall.

The need to free up space arouses the need to know about the potential steps for checking storage and cleaning up space, which is discussed as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to navigate into “Settings” and look for the “Battery and device care” section. As you lead next, select the “Storage” option to check the Android storage and see how it is segregated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-4.jpg"                      alt="open the storage settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you navigate to the next screen, you can free up space by removing the applications from your Android. For that, tap on “Apps” to open a section containing the list of applications installed on the Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-5.jpg"                      alt="access the installed apps info"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go through the list of applications and select any app you want to remove. As you navigate next, select “Uninstall” to lead to removing the app from the Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-android-system-crash-6.jpg"                      alt="press the uninstall option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-7-Clear-cache-partition-to-fix-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-7-Clear-cache-partition-to-fix-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Clear cache partition to fix Android crash issue"></a>Part 7: Clear cache partition to fix Android crash issue</h2><p>Clearing cache is a good idea because it cleans your device and reduces the burden on the Android software and gives it enough space to function normally and carry out its operations.</p><p>In case the Android system crash issue is temporary, follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:</p><p>1. On your Xiaomi 14 Pro, visit “Settings” and find “Storage”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14989068987919.jpg"                      alt="android settings"                ></p><p>2. Now tap on “Cached Data”, and then click “OK” to clear all unwanted cache from your device as shown above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992219452.jpg"                                     ></p><p>However, if the Android crash problem is such that your phone has frozen, becomes unresponsive, and does not turn on, you must first boot into the Recovery Mode screen.</p><p>1. Press the volume down button and power button together until you see a screen with multiple options before you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992495864.jpg"                      alt="boot in recovery mode"                ></p><p>2. Once you are on the Recovery Mode screen, use the volume down key to scroll down and select ”Wipe cache partition” as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14988992704405.jpeg"                      alt="wipe cache partition"                ></p><p>3. After the process is completed, select “Reboot System” which is the first option in the recovery mode screen.</p><p>This method will help you erase all the clogged-up and unwanted files and resolve the Android system crash issue. If clearing cache doesn’t help, try formatting your SD Card.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-8-Remove-the-SD-card-to-fix-the-Android-crash-issue"><a href="#Part-8-Remove-the-SD-card-to-fix-the-Android-crash-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Remove the SD card to fix the Android crash issue"></a>Part 8: Remove the SD card to fix the Android crash issue</h2><p>Removing and formatting your SD Card to fix the Android System crash issue is helpful when a corrupted SD Card disturbs the Android software forcing it to shut down suddenly.</p><p>To format your SD Card, just follow the instructions below.</p><p>1.

Check hidden apps"></a>1. Check hidden apps</h3><p>How could the <strong>Android phone icon be missing</strong>? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.</p><p>However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to your phone’s Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Use the search bar to look for “Hidden app.”</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you find the “Hidden app” settings, watch the list to see if the missing app is there. If it is, you can toggle off the switch to unhide it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-2.jpg"                      alt="Unhide any hidden apps on Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer"><a href="#2-Move-the-app-to-the-home-screen-from-the-App-Drawer" class="headerlink" title="2.

Follow the step-by-step guide below:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you <strong>lost the phone icon on Android</strong>. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/missing-app-icon-android-3.jpg"                      alt="Open the App Drawer on Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Re-enable-disabled-app"><a href="#3-Re-enable-disabled-app" class="headerlink" title="3.

Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as ‘Freezer,’ allowing users to temporarily halt the apps.

Open the Apps &amp; Notifications on the Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen.

This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg"                      alt="android remove screen protector"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#Method-2-Clean-Your-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone"></a>Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone</h3><p>A <strong>touchscreen malfunctioning</strong> can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg"                      alt="android dirty screen"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While"><a href="#Method-3-Stop-Using-Your-Android-Device-for-a-While" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While"></a>Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While</h3><p><strong>Touch problems</strong> also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Restart-Your-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Restart-Your-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Restart Your Android"></a>Method 4: Restart Your Android</h3><p>Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue.

Here’s how.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>Placing your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong> is different depending on your Android smartphone.

Continue holding them until the screen starts.</p><p><strong>Step 1C</strong>: If step 1A did not put your Android into <strong>Recovery Mode</strong>, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Volume Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Use the <strong>Volume</strong> buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset, and confirm your choice with the <strong>Power</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg"                      alt="android recovery mode 02"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Wait for the process to complete and for your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) to restart automatically.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen"><a href="#Method-7-Replace-Your-Android-Touchscreen" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen"></a>Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen</h3><p>If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the <strong>touchscreen problem,</strong> it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg"                      alt="图像"                >“</p><h3 id="Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center"><a href="#Method-8-Bring-it-to-an-Authorized-Service-Center" class="headerlink" title="Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center"></a>Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center</h3><p>Your <strong>phone touch problem</strong> might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced.

Here’s how you can safely get to the Android recovery system on your Huawei Nova Y91.</p><p>Step 1: Hold down the power key and then select “Power Off” from the options on the screen. If, however, your screen is unresponsive, keep holding the power key for several seconds until the Huawei Nova Y91 device is completely turned off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-01.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you need to hold down the Power and the Volume Key. You should able to see the Android image and a bunch of information about your device. There should also be a “Start” at the top right corner of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-02.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><p>Step 3: Press the Volume up and Volume down keys and use the Power key to select menu options. Press the Volume down key twice to see “Recovery Mode” in red at the top of the screen. Press the Power key to select it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-03.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><p>Step 4: The white Google logo will appear immediately followed by the Android logo again as well as the words “No Command” at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-04.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><p>Step 5: Finally, press and hold both the Power and the Volume up Key for around 3 seconds and then let go of the Volume up Key but keep holding the Power Key. You should see the Android system recovery options at the top of the screen. Use the Volume keys to highlight and the Power key to select the one you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-05.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Android-Stuck-at-System-Recovery-How-to-fix-in-one-click"><a href="#Part-3-Android-Stuck-at-System-Recovery-How-to-fix-in-one-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Huawei Nova Y91 device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Huawei Nova Y91 device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Huawei Nova Y91 device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Huawei Nova Y91 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Huawei Nova Y91, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Huawei Nova Y91 device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="Calls-on-Huawei-Nova-Y91-Go-Straight-to-Voicemail-12-Fixes"><a href="#Calls-on-Huawei-Nova-Y91-Go-Straight-to-Voicemail-12-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="Calls on Huawei Nova Y91 Go Straight to Voicemail? 12 Fixes"></a>Calls on Huawei Nova Y91 Go Straight to Voicemail? 12 Fixes</h2><p>Have you ever experienced incoming calls to your <strong>phone go straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing? It can be frustrating, especially if you’re expecting an important call. It could be due to simple things like turning down the volume or forgetting to turn off the Do Not Disturb mode. In other cases, it might be because you accidentally blocked the caller’s number.</p><p>In most cases, incoming calls going to voicemail without ringing are common. However, if it’s happening frequently or for all calls, your phone may have a problem.</p><p>This article will discuss why incoming <strong>phone calls go straight to voicemail</strong> and how to fix the problem. We’ll also show you how to use Wondershare Dr.Fone, a powerful Android System Repair tool, to solve such issues. So, if you’re uncertain why that last <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>, keep reading, and we’ll cover everything you need to know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-01.jpg"                      alt="phone voicemail notification representation"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Not-Ringing-Here’s-Why-Calls-on-Your-Phone-Go-Straight-to-Voicemail"><a href="#Part-1-Not-Ringing-Here’s-Why-Calls-on-Your-Phone-Go-Straight-to-Voicemail" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail"></a>Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail</h2><p>If an incoming call to your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:</p><ol><li>Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</li></ol><p>DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone calls.

And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.</p><ul><li>Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage.
