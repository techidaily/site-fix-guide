Not to mention, the Nokia C22 has borne a whole lot of heat from its agitated users over the years and the reason is pretty much obvious due to the pre-installed bloatware apps and the theme launch “TouchWiz home”. That not just brutally annoys users and eats up a heck of internal storage space but lags up too often due to low speed and stability. As a result users end up with “Unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped” and “Unfortunately, TouchWiz has stopped”. Apparently, there are several flaws in the design and functioning of this launcher and hence, Touchwiz keeps stopping or becomes unresponsive.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-scenarios-when-TouchWiz-keeps-stopping"><a href="#Part-1-Common-scenarios-when-TouchWiz-keeps-stopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common scenarios when TouchWiz keeps stopping"></a>Part 1: Common scenarios when TouchWiz keeps stopping</h2><p>Here in this section, we will introduce some scenarios that can be blamed for why <strong><em>TouchWiz is not working</em></strong>. Check out the following points:</p><ul><li>More often than not, the <strong><em>TouchWiz keeps stopping</em></strong> <strong><u>after an Android update. </u></strong> When we update our Nokia C22 device, the old data and cache usually conflicts with TouchWIz thereby cropping up this mess.</li><li>When you <strong><u>disable some built-in apps</u></strong>, you might get in trouble with TouchWiz. Doing this sometimes can hamper the TouchWiz operation and raise the “**<em>unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped</em>**” error message.</li><li>Many times <strong><u>installing some third-party apps and widgets</u></strong> can cause this problem. The apps like launchers can be conflicting with TouchWiz home launcher and therefore cease it to work.

However, Nokia C22 stands as an exception in such case. And therefore, many times <strong><em>TouchWiz starts stopping</em></strong> right after upgrading. Thus, due to the collection of cache data, TouchWiz can display error. This calls for removing the cache from TouchWiz and run things smoothly. Here is how to do this:</p><ul><li>Tap on “Apps” from the Home screen firstly.</li><li>Launch “Settings” afterwards</li><li>Look for “Applications” and tap on it followed by “Application Manager”.</li><li>When Application Manager gets opened, swipe towards right to get into the “All” screen.</li><li>Now, choose “TouchWiz” and tap “Clear Cache”.</li><li>Now, tap “Clear Data” followed by “OK”.</li><li>Now restart your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-cache-touchwiz.jpg"                      alt="clear cache to fix touchwiz home stopping"                ></p><p>Please note that this will delete all your Home screens post this method.</p><h3 id="Disable-Motion-gesture-settings"><a href="#Disable-Motion-gesture-settings" class="headerlink" title="Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings"></a>Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings</h3><p>The functions regarding Motions and Gestures can be responsible for why <strong><em>TouchWiz home has stopped</em></strong> in your device. Usually the Nokia C22 devices running on Android version less than Marshmallow are prone to encountering this issue. Or the Nokia C22 devices having modest specs often fall prey to the issue. When you disable these settings, you might get out of the problem.</p><h3 id="Change-the-Animation-Scale"><a href="#Change-the-Animation-Scale" class="headerlink" title="Change the Animation Scale"></a>Change the Animation Scale</h3><p>When you use TouchWiz, it may consume higher memory usage for high amount of graphic maintenance.

Here’s how:</p><h3 id="Clear-Cache-Partition"><a href="#Clear-Cache-Partition" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cache Partition"></a>Clear Cache Partition</h3><p>In case the above steps didn’t figure out the problem, here is the next tip.

This feature aims to make the user experience more efficient by simply eliminating complex features. The Easy Mode removes those features that confuse the users by messing up the screen. Hence, we suggest you to switch to this mode in order to remove “**<em>TouchWiz not working</em>**” problem. The steps are:</p><ul><li>Open “Settings” and go to “Personalization”.</li><li>Hit on “Easy Mode” now.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/easy-mode.jpg"                      alt="easy mode to fix TouchWiz stopping"                ></p><p>Hope the <strong><em>TouchWiz won’t keep stopping</em></strong> error does not pop up anymore!</p><h3 id="Boot-your-phone-to-safe-mode"><a href="#Boot-your-phone-to-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Boot your phone to safe mode"></a>Boot your phone to safe mode</h3><p>Here is the next solution to be followed when TouchWiz keeps stopping. As we already said, third-party apps can cause this issue, booting your device in the Safe mode will disable those apps temporarily. Hence you need to boot your Nokia C22 device to Safe mode and check if the reason is any third-party app.</p><ul><li>Switch off your device to initiate.</li><li>Press “Power” button and keep doing this until device’s logo appears on the screen.</li><li>When you see logo appearing, instantly release the button and start holding “Volume Down” button.</li><li>Keep holding until rebooting finishes.</li><li>You will now witness “Safe mode” on the bottom screen. You can now release the button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/enable-safe-mode.jpg"                      alt="safe mode"                ></p><h3 id="Reset-Factory-settings"><a href="#Reset-Factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Factory settings"></a>Reset Factory settings</h3><p>If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.</p><p>Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:</p><ul><li>Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup &amp; Reset”.</li><li>Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.</li><li>Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/reset-factory-settings.jpg"                      alt="reset factory settings"                ></p><ul><li>Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.</li></ul><h3 id="Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz"><a href="#Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz" class="headerlink" title="Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz"></a>Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz</h3><p>We believe that you will find the above methods helpful.

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Nokia C22 and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”.

RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Nokia C22 device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings. Also, if the apps in the background keep running, they might conflict with the Settings and stop it to perform properly. Therefore clearing RAM is important when Android Settings is not responding. Here is how to do it.</p><ol><li>Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Nokia C12 Plus device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Nokia C12 Plus device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Nokia C12 Plus device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key.

The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Nokia C12 Plus is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Nokia C12 Plus, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Nokia C12 Plus device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="Best-Methods-for-Nokia-C12-Plus-Won’t-Turn-On"><a href="#Best-Methods-for-Nokia-C12-Plus-Won’t-Turn-On" class="headerlink" title="Best Methods for Nokia C12 Plus Won’t Turn On"></a>Best Methods for Nokia C12 Plus Won’t Turn On</h2><p>The Nokia C12 Plus 3 boasts numerous impressive features, making it a desirable phone.

Most of the time, you don’t know whether you have lost all of your important Android data. It is even more worrying because of the fact that you cannot turn on your device at all, especially when you don’t know how to fix it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Android-System-Recovery"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Android-System-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Here’s how you can safely get to the Android recovery system on your Nokia C02.</p><p>Step 1: Hold down the power key and then select “Power Off” from the options on the screen. If, however, your screen is unresponsive, keep holding the power key for several seconds until the Nokia C02 device is completely turned off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-01.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you need to hold down the Power and the Volume Key.

You should see the Android system recovery options at the top of the screen. Use the Volume keys to highlight and the Power key to select the one you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-05.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Android-Stuck-at-System-Recovery-How-to-fix-in-one-click"><a href="#Part-3-Android-Stuck-at-System-Recovery-How-to-fix-in-one-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Nokia C02 device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Nokia C02 device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Nokia C02 device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Nokia C02 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Nokia C02, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Nokia C02 device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card.

Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail"></a>Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail</h2><p>If an incoming call to your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:</p><ol><li>Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode</li></ol><p>DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your <strong>cell phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the <strong>Do not disturb</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-02.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb mode not enabled"                ></p><p>Here’s an alternative way:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Do not disturb</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-03.jpg"                      alt="notifications settings interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> offto disable the mode.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>Turn Off Call Forwarding</li></ol><p>One reason calls go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong> is if you enabled call forwarding. Call forwarding is a feature that redirects incoming calls to another number. To turn off call forwarding:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app on your device, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg"                      alt="phone dial app settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call forwarding</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-05.jpg"                      alt="call settings supplementary services"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>Disable Call Barring</li></ol><p>If a phone <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Nokia C02 devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone Dialer</strong> app, then tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Supplementary services</strong> &gt; <strong>Call barring</strong>, then tap <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Voice call</strong>, then turn off your preferred outgoing and incoming calls. When prompted, enter 0000 as a password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-06.jpg"                      alt="call barring settings interface"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>Update Your Phone’s Software</li></ol><p>Sometimes, software bugs can cause problems with incoming calls, which may be why your last incoming <strong>call went straight to voicemail</strong>. If your phone runs outdated software, try updating it to the latest version.</p><p>To check for updates, open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and go to <strong>Software update</strong> or <strong>System update</strong>. For a seamless update experience, follow the step-by-step instructions on your mobile screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-07.jpg"                      alt="software update settings"                ></p><ol start="5"><li>Reset Network Settings</li></ol><p>If the incoming calls on your <strong>phone go straight to voicemail</strong>, consider resetting your phone’s network settings. Network settings control how your phone connects to the cellular network. If these settings are not set up correctly, incoming calls may not be able to reach your device.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Resetting your network settings will erase any saved Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth pairings, requiring you to re-enter them after the reset is complete.</p><p>To reset your network settings on most Android devices:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your smartphone, then tap <strong>System</strong> or <strong>General Management</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Reset</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> and confirm the action.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-08.jpg"                      alt="phone reset network settings"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>Turn Off Bluetooth</li></ol><p>When Bluetooth is on, it can interfere with your device’s ability to receive calls, causing them to go <strong>straight to voicemail without ringing</strong>. To turn off <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-16/fix-wifi-bluetooth-issues-after-upgrading-ios-16.html"><u> Bluetooth</u></a> on an Android device, you can do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the Quick Settingspanel, then tap the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> icon to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-09.jpg"                      alt="bluetooth not enabled"                ></p><ul><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Connections</strong> &gt; <strong>Bluetooth</strong> and toggle the switch off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-10.jpg"                      alt="turn off bluetooth on settings app"                ></p><p>It should help ensure that calls come through to your phone instead of going to voicemail.</p><ol start="7"><li>Check Airplane Mode</li></ol><p>If turning off Bluetooth didn’t solve the issue, another possible cause could be that your phone is in Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode turns off all wireless connections on your phone, including cellular service, which can cause calls to <strong>dial straight to voicemail</strong>. There are two ways to turn off Airplane mode on Android:</p><p>Using the Settings app:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong>.</li></ul><p>Using the Quick Settings panel:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the phone screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the <strong>Airplane mode</strong> or <strong>Flight mode</strong> icon, then tap it to turn it off.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-11.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode on"                ></p><ol start="8"><li>Check Blocked Numbers</li></ol><p><strong>“My boyfriend’s phone goes straight to voicemail</strong> when someone is calling. Any idea why that might be?”</p><p>Do you also find yourself asking what does it mean? It could be that he has blocked that phone number. To check this:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Phone dialer</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>menu</strong> icon in the top right corner and select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Block numbers</strong>. If you find the number in the blocked list, remove it to ensure that their calls come through to the phone.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-12.jpg"                      alt="block numbers on the phone"                ></p><p>If you still have trouble reaching your boyfriend, try calling him from a different number.

To turn off Google One VPN:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Google One</strong> app on your Nokia C02.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> At the bottom, go to the <strong>Benefits</strong> tab, then tap <strong>View Details</strong> below the <strong>Online protection with a VPN</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-13.jpg"                      alt="google one app interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Enable VPN</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-14.jpg"                      alt="turn off google one vpn"                ></p><ol start="10"><li>Contact Your Carrier</li></ol><p>If your <strong>phone calls go straight to voicemail</strong> after trying all the above, contact your carrier for help. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or determine if there is a service outage in your area.</p><p>And if your carrier confirms that there is no service outage or billing-related block, the problem may be with your phone itself.

An “Application not installed” error message usually pops up when you are trying to download and install an App with a .apk file extension from somewhere other than the Google Play Store. The error is very confusing at first but makes sense when you realize that this unknown Error Code during Application installation is neither a software issue nor a hardware problem. It is a direct outcome of what you do with your device. Yes, you heard that right. Your faulty actions can cause Android App not installed error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/app-not-installed-error-in-android.jpg"                      alt="app not install on android"                ></p><p>What to do when trying to install the Android APK it says “app not installed”? It is terrible that you can’t install App on your device. But in this article, you will know more about the causes behind this error and the best ways to fix it, read on, here is all you need to know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error"><a href="#Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error"></a>Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error</h2><p>You may ask: Why can’t I download apps on my Motorola Razr 40? Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Motorola Razr 40 device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Motorola Razr 40 device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7. Incorrect file</p><p>If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.</p><p>The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994439892909.jpg"                      alt="application not installed" title="application not installed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-fix-App-not-installed-on-Android-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error"></a>Part 2: One-click to fix App not installed on Android error</h2><p>So App not installed on your Motorola Razr 40 or tablet?

It is even more worrying because of the fact that you cannot turn on your device at all, especially when you don’t know how to fix it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Android-System-Recovery"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Android-System-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You should see the Android system recovery options at the top of the screen. Use the Volume keys to highlight and the Power key to select the one you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-system-recovery-05.jpg"                      alt="stuck at android system recovery"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Android-Stuck-at-System-Recovery-How-to-fix-in-one-click"><a href="#Part-3-Android-Stuck-at-System-Recovery-How-to-fix-in-one-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Motorola Moto G84 5G device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Motorola Moto G84 5G device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Motorola Moto G84 5G device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Motorola Moto G84 5G is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Motorola Moto G84 5G, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Motorola Moto G84 5G device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card.

It is terrible that you can’t install App on your device. But in this article, you will know more about the causes behind this error and the best ways to fix it, read on, here is all you need to know.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error"><a href="#Part-1-Common-reasons-for-the-“Android-App-not-installed”-error" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error"></a>Part 1: Common reasons for the “Android App not installed” error</h2><p>You may ask: Why can’t I download apps on my Motorola Moto G84 5G? Understanding the underlying causes of the “Android App Not Installed” error is crucial for resolving the issue effectively. So, what are the reasons for Android App not installed error? Given below are a few reasons:</p><p>1. Insufficient storage</p><p>Android software and if data such as photos, videos, music, messages, apps, contacts, emails, etc are stored in the internal memory there is not adequate storage left for another App, leading to Android App not installed error.</p><p>2. Corrupted&#x2F;Contaminated App file</p><p>When you do not download Apps from the Play Store and choose another platform to do so, App files are usually corrupted and hence cannot be installed on your device smoothly. You should be doubly sure of the source from where you download an App, check its extension name, and make an effort not to install contained files.</p><p>3. SD Card not mounted in the Motorola Moto G84 5G device</p><p>At times your phone could be connected to your PC or another electronic device that can access the SD Card from your device. In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.</p><p>4. Storage location</p><p>You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Motorola Moto G84 5G device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn’t installed because of an unknown Error Code.</p><p>5. Corrupt storage</p><p>Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn’t installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.</p><p>6. Application Permission</p><p>Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.</p><p>7.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Motorola Moto G24 device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Motorola Moto G24 device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Motorola Moto G24 device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Motorola Moto G24 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Motorola Moto G24, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Motorola Moto G24 device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="6-Fixes-to-Unfortunately-WhatsApp-has-stopped-Error-Popups-On-Motorola-Moto-G24"><a href="#6-Fixes-to-Unfortunately-WhatsApp-has-stopped-Error-Popups-On-Motorola-Moto-G24" class="headerlink" title="6 Fixes to Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped Error Popups On Motorola Moto G24"></a>6 Fixes to Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped Error Popups On Motorola Moto G24</h2><p>Ever seen a wheel going on without cog?

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Motorola Moto G14 device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Motorola Moto G14 device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Motorola Moto G14 device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key.

Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Motorola Moto G14 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Motorola Moto G14, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Motorola Moto G14 device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="Reasons-for-Motorola-Moto-G14-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen-and-Ways-To-Fix-Them"><a href="#Reasons-for-Motorola-Moto-G14-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen-and-Ways-To-Fix-Them" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Motorola Moto G14 Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them"></a>Reasons for Motorola Moto G14 Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them</h2><p>One of the main reasons why people own a phone is for convenience.

Why Is Your Motorola Moto G14 Stuck on the Boot Screen?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Motorola Moto G14 Stuck on the Boot Screen?</h2><p>There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> happens and some tips to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-Changes-to-the-Software"><a href="#1-Changes-to-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Changes to the Software"></a>1. Changes to the Software</h3><p>Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.</p><p>Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an <strong><strong>Android phone stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.</p><h3 id="2-Android-Software-Updates"><a href="#2-Android-Software-Updates" class="headerlink" title="2. Android Software Updates"></a>2. Android Software Updates</h3><p>Updates are a common cause of <strong><strong>Android phones stuck on the logo</strong></strong>. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong> and many others might occur.</p><p>Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.</p><p>When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Motorola Moto G14 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your <strong><strong>Android phone getting stuck on the logo</strong></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-01.jpg"                      alt="updating software"                ></p><h3 id="3-Malfunctioning-Applications"><a href="#3-Malfunctioning-Applications" class="headerlink" title="3. Malfunctioning Applications"></a>3. Malfunctioning Applications</h3><p>If you noticed that your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.</p><p>This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Motorola Moto G14 functioning properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/reasons-for-android-phone-stuck-on-boot-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg"                      alt="malfunctioning apps on android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-5-Helpful-Ways-To-Fix-Android-Phones-Stuck-on-Boot-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen"></a>Part 2. 5 Helpful Ways To Fix Android Phones Stuck on Boot Screen</h2><p>After understanding the common problems on why your <strong><strong>Android phone is stuck on the logo</strong></strong> page, here are five easy solutions you can try solving at home.</p><h3 id="1-Force-Reboot"><a href="#1-Force-Reboot" class="headerlink" title="1. Force Reboot"></a>1. Force Reboot</h3><p>When encountering problems with your Motorola Moto G14, such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>, you should first try a forced reboot.

This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Motorola Moto G14 device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Motorola Moto G14 to become slower and eventually get stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.</p><p>Wiping out the cache data from your Motorola Moto G14 could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the <strong><strong>Android boot screen</strong></strong>.

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Motorola Moto G13 and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”.

Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Motorola Moto G04, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Motorola Moto G04 device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive.

It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="Super-Easy-Ways-To-Deal-with-Motorola-Moto-G04-Unresponsive-Screen"><a href="#Super-Easy-Ways-To-Deal-with-Motorola-Moto-G04-Unresponsive-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Super Easy Ways To Deal with Motorola Moto G04 Unresponsive Screen"></a>Super Easy Ways To Deal with Motorola Moto G04 Unresponsive Screen</h2><p>The evolution of smartphones signifies the development of mobile communication technology.

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Motorola Edge 40 device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Motorola Edge 40 device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Motorola Edge 40 device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Motorola Edge 40 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Motorola Edge 40, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Motorola Edge 40 device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="Android-Safe-Mode-How-to-Turn-off-Safe-Mode-on-Motorola-Edge-40"><a href="#Android-Safe-Mode-How-to-Turn-off-Safe-Mode-on-Motorola-Edge-40" class="headerlink" title="Android Safe Mode - How to Turn off Safe Mode on Motorola Edge 40?"></a>Android Safe Mode - How to Turn off Safe Mode on Motorola Edge 40?</h2><p>Safe mode on Android is very useful to get rid of dangerous apps and malware.

It is a feature that will end any excessive background functioning of the Motorola Edge 40 device. For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode. Since the important functions and the naïve apps will be running on the Motorola Edge 40 device, you will get to know if it’s really a software glitch or not by running the Phone app in Safe mode. And this is the first solution we would recommend you make use of when the Phone app has stopped. Here is how to enable Safe Mode.</p><ol><li>Switch off the Motorola Edge 40 phone first.</li><li>Now keep pressing the “Power” button until you see the Motorola Edge 40 logo on the screen.</li><li>Release the button and immediately press and hold the “Volume Down” key.</li><li>Leave the key once the Motorola Edge 40 device is in Safe mode.

Due to the constant usage, the temporary files get collected and may corrupt if not cleared. Hence, the next solution you should try when the Phone app keeps stopping is to clear the cache. Here are the steps to be performed.</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your device and go to “Application” or “Apps”.</li><li>Now from the list of all applications, go to “Phone” and tap on it.</li><li>Now, click on “Storage” and choose “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-phone.jpg"                      alt="Phone app crashing - clear cache"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Update-Google-Play-services"><a href="#2-3-Update-Google-Play-services" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Update Google Play services"></a>2.3 Update Google Play services</h3><p>Since Android is created by Google, there must be some Google Play services that are crucial to run several system functions. And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.</p><h3 id="2-4-Update-the-Motorola-Edge-40-firmware"><a href="#2-4-Update-the-Motorola-Edge-40-firmware" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Update the Motorola Edge 40 firmware"></a>2.4 Update the Motorola Edge 40 firmware</h3><p>When the firmware is not updated, it may conflict with some apps and maybe that’s why your Phone app falls prey.

These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.</p><p>Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device</p><p>If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Motorola Defy 2 device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.</p><p>Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions</p><p>Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.</p><p>Screen Mirroring</p><p>Smart View allows you to display your Motorola Defy 2 device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Swipe down the top of the screen to access the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> panel.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the <strong>Smart View</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap <strong>Start Now</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-10.jpg"                      alt="cast samsung phone using smart view"                ></p><p>Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Motorola Defy 2 Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.</p><p>Use Disable Flag Secure Magisk Module</p><p>Still experiencing the error message, “<strong>Can’t take screenshot due to security policy?” Bypass Android</strong> phone error like this using a module.</p><p>The module patches the Android framework to remove the FLAG_SECURE flag from apps. It is a relatively simple process but requires root access and Magisk. This module will turn off the security flag to take screenshots in Incognito mode and other apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-11.jpg"                      alt="magiskzip disable flag secure module"                ></p><p>Authors Verdict</p><p>There are a few ways to bypass screenshot restrictions on Android apps and websites, but some methods are more complicated than others.

But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.</p><p>Although there are ways to bypass the “<strong>Can’t take screenshot due to security policy</strong>” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.</p><p>If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-realme-c67-4g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Spotify Keeps Crashing A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Realme C67 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-realme-11x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Spotify Keeps Crashing A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Realme 11X 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-exploiting-b-roll-for-visual-impact-on-projects-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploiting B Roll for Visual Impact on Projects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/windows-memory-assessment-made-easy/"><u>Windows Memory Assessment Made Easy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-samsung-galaxy-a25-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Spotify Keeps Crashing A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Samsung Galaxy A25 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-advanced-editing-text-insertion-tips-on-images-in-microsofts-photos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock Advanced Editing  Text Insertion Tips on Images in Microsoft's Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Spotify Keeps Crashing A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Samsung Galaxy A34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-realme-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Spotify Keeps Crashing A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Realme 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/spotify-keeps-crashing-a-complete-list-of-fixes-you-can-use-on-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Spotify Keeps Crashing A Complete List of Fixes You Can Use on Samsung Galaxy A15 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-a-step-by-step-pathway-to-messaging-media-download-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Step-by-Step Pathway to Messaging Media Download for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/pinterest-vid-extractor-guide-top-5-free-tools-summary/"><u>Pinterest Vid Extractor Guide  Top 5 FREE Tools Summary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-oppo-k11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Oppo K11 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-passcode-from-iphone-11-complete-guide-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Remove Passcode From iPhone 11?

How to fix in a common way?</h2><p>If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here’s how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device’s manual before attempting this process.</p><p>Step 1: Power off the Lenovo ThinkPhone device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Lenovo ThinkPhone device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.</p><p>Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Lenovo ThinkPhone device vibrates.</p><p>Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.</p><p>Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the “Wipe Data&#x2F; Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.</p><p>Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight “Delete All User Data” and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the “Reboot System Now” option.</p><p>Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html" >reboot the phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in normal mode.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System"><a href="#Part-5-Backup-and-Restore-Android-System" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System"></a>Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System</h2><p>Losing data on your Lenovo ThinkPhone is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don’t really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here’s how to easily do that.</p><p>Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Lenovo ThinkPhone, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.</p><p>Step 3: After the process is complete, choose “Reboot” to restart the Lenovo ThinkPhone device.</p><p>Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery &gt; backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.</p><p>To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup &amp; Restore from the menu list.</p><p>Step 2: Press “Restore” to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created</p><p>Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.</p><p>Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.</p><h2 id="Lenovo-ThinkPhone-Bootloop-Problem-How-to-Fix-it-Without-Data-Loss"><a href="#Lenovo-ThinkPhone-Bootloop-Problem-How-to-Fix-it-Without-Data-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Lenovo ThinkPhone Bootloop Problem, How to Fix it Without Data Loss"></a>Lenovo ThinkPhone Bootloop Problem, How to Fix it Without Data Loss</h2><p>Have you, like many other users, faced the bootloop Android problem and wondered what exactly is Android boot loop. Well, Android boot loop is nothing but an error that makes your phone switch on itself every time you manually turn it off.

When in Safe Mode, the Lenovo ThinkPhone device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won’t run. Here’s how you can boot your Lenovo ThinkPhone into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Power Off Your Device</strong></p><p>Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Safe Mode</strong></p><p>To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:</p><ul><li>For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer’s logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Lenovo ThinkPhone device finishes booting. You should see “Safe Mode” displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.</li><li>Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device’s user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3: Observe the Lenovo ThinkPhone device</strong></p><p>Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn’t occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps</strong></p><p>Now that you’re in Safe Mode, it’s time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Restart Normally</strong></p><p>Once you’ve identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.</p><p>By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Lenovo ThinkPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue"><a href="#Part-4-Factory-reset-to-fix-Android-bootloop-issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue"></a>Part 4: Factory reset to fix Android bootloop issue</h2><p>Factory reset, also known as Hard Reset, is a one-stop solution for all your software resulting in issues.

Not to mention, the Lenovo ThinkPhone has borne a whole lot of heat from its agitated users over the years and the reason is pretty much obvious due to the pre-installed bloatware apps and the theme launch “TouchWiz home”. That not just brutally annoys users and eats up a heck of internal storage space but lags up too often due to low speed and stability.

However, Lenovo ThinkPhone stands as an exception in such case. And therefore, many times <strong><em>TouchWiz starts stopping</em></strong> right after upgrading. Thus, due to the collection of cache data, TouchWiz can display error. This calls for removing the cache from TouchWiz and run things smoothly. Here is how to do this:</p><ul><li>Tap on “Apps” from the Home screen firstly.</li><li>Launch “Settings” afterwards</li><li>Look for “Applications” and tap on it followed by “Application Manager”.</li><li>When Application Manager gets opened, swipe towards right to get into the “All” screen.</li><li>Now, choose “TouchWiz” and tap “Clear Cache”.</li><li>Now, tap “Clear Data” followed by “OK”.</li><li>Now restart your device.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-cache-touchwiz.jpg"                      alt="clear cache to fix touchwiz home stopping"                ></p><p>Please note that this will delete all your Home screens post this method.</p><h3 id="Disable-Motion-gesture-settings"><a href="#Disable-Motion-gesture-settings" class="headerlink" title="Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings"></a>Disable Motion &amp; gesture settings</h3><p>The functions regarding Motions and Gestures can be responsible for why <strong><em>TouchWiz home has stopped</em></strong> in your device. Usually the Lenovo ThinkPhone devices running on Android version less than Marshmallow are prone to encountering this issue. Or the Lenovo ThinkPhone devices having modest specs often fall prey to the issue. When you disable these settings, you might get out of the problem.</p><h3 id="Change-the-Animation-Scale"><a href="#Change-the-Animation-Scale" class="headerlink" title="Change the Animation Scale"></a>Change the Animation Scale</h3><p>When you use TouchWiz, it may consume higher memory usage for high amount of graphic maintenance. As a result, the “**<em>unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped</em>**” error might crop up. Taking this into consideration, you should try reconfiguring the animation scale and get rid of the error. Here’s how:</p><h3 id="Clear-Cache-Partition"><a href="#Clear-Cache-Partition" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cache Partition"></a>Clear Cache Partition</h3><p>In case the above steps didn’t figure out the problem, here is the next tip. This method can be counted as one of the most effective one. Because it is able to fix minor issues in Android devices, we recommend you for “**<em>TouchWiz home has stopped</em>**” issue too. Let us know how you can do it:</p><ul><li>Turn off your Lenovo ThinkPhone device.</li><li>Start pressing and holding “Volume Up” and “Power” buttons simultaneously.</li><li>Keep doing this until you see the Android screen. This will take your device into recovery mode.</li><li>You will observe some options on the screen. Take help of Volume buttons, scroll down to choose “Wipe Cache Partition”. Press Power button to confirm and the Lenovo ThinkPhone device will be rebooted.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-cache-partition.jpg"                      alt="clear cache partition"                ></p><p>Check now if the error is eliminated. If unfortunately not, please try the following solution.</p><h3 id="Enable-the-easy-mode"><a href="#Enable-the-easy-mode" class="headerlink" title="Enable the easy mode"></a>Enable the easy mode</h3><p>For some users, enabling Easy Mode has been of great assistance. This feature aims to make the user experience more efficient by simply eliminating complex features. The Easy Mode removes those features that confuse the users by messing up the screen. Hence, we suggest you to switch to this mode in order to remove “**<em>TouchWiz not working</em>**” problem. The steps are:</p><ul><li>Open “Settings” and go to “Personalization”.</li><li>Hit on “Easy Mode” now.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/easy-mode.jpg"                      alt="easy mode to fix TouchWiz stopping"                ></p><p>Hope the <strong><em>TouchWiz won’t keep stopping</em></strong> error does not pop up anymore!</p><h3 id="Boot-your-phone-to-safe-mode"><a href="#Boot-your-phone-to-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Boot your phone to safe mode"></a>Boot your phone to safe mode</h3><p>Here is the next solution to be followed when TouchWiz keeps stopping. As we already said, third-party apps can cause this issue, booting your device in the Safe mode will disable those apps temporarily. Hence you need to boot your Lenovo ThinkPhone device to Safe mode and check if the reason is any third-party app.</p><ul><li>Switch off your device to initiate.</li><li>Press “Power” button and keep doing this until device’s logo appears on the screen.</li><li>When you see logo appearing, instantly release the button and start holding “Volume Down” button.</li><li>Keep holding until rebooting finishes.</li><li>You will now witness “Safe mode” on the bottom screen. You can now release the button.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/enable-safe-mode.jpg"                      alt="safe mode"                ></p><h3 id="Reset-Factory-settings"><a href="#Reset-Factory-settings" class="headerlink" title="Reset Factory settings"></a>Reset Factory settings</h3><p>If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.</p><p>Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:</p><ul><li>Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup &amp; Reset”.</li><li>Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.</li><li>Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/reset-factory-settings.jpg"                      alt="reset factory settings"                ></p><ul><li>Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.</li></ul><h3 id="Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz"><a href="#Install-a-new-launcher-to-replace-TouchWiz" class="headerlink" title="Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz"></a>Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz</h3><p>We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your <strong><em>TouchWiz is not working</em></strong>, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

And hence, it was triggering SIM not responding issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/insert-sim-properly.jpg"                      alt="fix SIM not responding - try another slot"                ></p><h3 id="2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones"><a href="#2-7-Try-the-SIM-card-in-other-phones" class="headerlink" title="2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones"></a>2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones</h3><p>Or just in case, you’ve still no joy and the SIM not provisioned on Android message is bothering you. Try making use of another Android device. Eject the SIM card from the Lava Yuva 3 device which is creating problems and try plugging it into other Lava Yuva 3] and other smartphones. Perhaps, this will let you know whether the issue is with your device only or with the SIM card itself.</p><h3 id="2-8-Try-a-new-SIM-card"><a href="#2-8-Try-a-new-SIM-card" class="headerlink" title="2.8 Try a new SIM card"></a>2.8 Try a new SIM card</h3><p>Still, wondering how to fix SIM not provisioned? Perhaps, nothing worked for you, right? Well, on that note, you must head to your carrier store and request a new SIM card. Also, inform them about the “SIM not provisioned MM2” error, they will be able to execute proper diagnostics over your old SIM card and hopefully get it resolved. Or else, they’ll equip you with a brand new SIM card and swap the new SIM card into your device and get it activated in the meantime. Eventually, restoring the normal functioning of your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In wrapping up, SIM not provisioned errors on Android can be troubling, but they’re certainly fixable.

If this combination is not working for you, search the internet with your device model number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14986725776650.jpg"                      alt="tap home, power and volume up"                ></p><p>Step 2 – Now you can find the recovery mode screen. Navigate to the “Wipe cache” option with the volume up and down button and select the option by tapping the power button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14986726461259.jpg"                      alt="Navigate to “Wipe cache”"                ></p><p>Step 3 – Now follow on-screen instruction and your device will be rebooted.</p><p>After successful completion of this method, your device should no longer be in safe mode. If the problem still persists, the only solution is to do a factory reset. This will erase all the data from your device. So take backup of your internal storage.</p><p><strong>Method 5: Factory data reset</strong></p><p>To factory data reset, you have to follow the below steps.</p><p>Step 1 – Enter in the recovery mode by following the steps mentioned earlier.</p><p>Step 2 – Now select “Factory data reset” from the given options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14986726765597.jpg"                      alt="select “Factory data reset”"                ></p><p>Step 3 – Now, follow the on-screen instructions and your device will be factory reset.</p><p>After this method, you can successfully get rid of the safe mode on Android. Restore your data from the backup you created.</p><p><strong>Watch the video below to turn off safe mode on your phone:</strong></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iiA3E-Oj_pk"></iframe><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-put-the-phone-in-safe-mode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-put-the-phone-in-safe-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to put the phone in safe mode?"></a>Part 2: How to put the phone in safe mode?</h2><p>If some apps or programs create a problem on your device, the solution is safe mode. Safe mode allows you to uninstall the app or the program out of your device safely. So, safe mode on Android is quite useful sometimes. Let’s have a look at how to turn on safe mode in Android.</p><p>Before this, remember to take a backup of your Lava Yuva 2 Pro. We recommend you to use the Dr.Fone - Phone Backup (Android). This tool is the best in its class to provide users with a very easy-to-use user interface yet powerful solution.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Phone-Backup-Android"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Phone-Backup-Android" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Phone Backup (Android)_"></a>Dr.Fone - Phone Backup (Android)_</h3><p>Flexibly Backup and Restore Android Data</p><ul><li>Selectively backup Android data to the computer with one click.</li><li>Preview and restore the backup to any Android devices.</li><li>Supports 8000+ Android devices.</li><li>There is no data lost during backup, export, or restore.</li></ul><p>Always remember to use this tool before you enter in the safe mode as you never know what will happen next and you might end up with factory resetting. This, as the result, will erase all your valuable data. So always perform backup data before you proceed.</p><p>To enter the safe mode, follow the instructions below.</p><p>Step  1 – First of all, long press the power button and let the Power options appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14986727492182.jpg"                      alt="Power options"                ></p><p>Step 2 – Now, long press on the “Power off” option. This will instantly ask you if you want to reboot into safe mode. Select the option and your device will reboot in safe mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14986728022827.jpg"                      alt="‘Power off”"                ></p><p>If you are using Android version 4.2 or earlier, turn off the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device and turn it on the back by tapping the power button. When the logo appears, tap and hold the volume down button. This will allow the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device to boot in safe mode.</p><p>Follow these steps carefully and now you can see a “Safe Mode” written at the corner of your device. This will confirm that you have successfully entered in Safe mode on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Safe-mode-on-Android-FAQs"><a href="#Part-3-Safe-mode-on-Android-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Safe mode on Android FAQs"></a>Part 3: Safe mode on Android FAQs</h2><p>In this section, we’ll discuss some frequently asked questions about the safe mode. Some users have many questions regarding the safe mode. Here we’ll try to cover some of them.</p><p><strong>1. Why is My Lava Yuva 2 Pro on safe mode?</strong></p><p>This is a very common question around the world. For many Android device users, it’s quite common to see your phone in safe mode suddenly. Android is a secure platform and if your device sees any threat from your recently installed apps or any programs that want to harm your device; it would go into safe mode automatically. Sometimes, you might accidentally perform the steps discussed in part 2 and boot your device in safe mode.</p><p><strong>2.

They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.</p><p>However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the <strong>Android phone is running slow and freezing</strong> over time. There can be many potential reasons why <strong>Android phone runs slow</strong> suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.</p><p>In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast"><a href="#Understanding-the-Specs-That-Make-Android-Phones-Run-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast"></a>Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast</h2><p>The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Lava Storm 5G device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Lava Storm 5G device’s overall performance and speed.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Core-Count"><a href="#The-CPU-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Core Count"></a>The CPU Core Count</h3><p>Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Lava Storm 5G device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Lava Storm 5G contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.</p><h3 id="The-CPU-Clock-Speed"><a href="#The-CPU-Clock-Speed" class="headerlink" title="The CPU Clock Speed"></a>The CPU Clock Speed</h3><p>Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Lava Storm 5G device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.</p><h3 id="Random-Access-Memory"><a href="#Random-Access-Memory" class="headerlink" title="Random Access Memory"></a>Random Access Memory</h3><p>In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.</p><h3 id="Internal-Storage"><a href="#Internal-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Internal Storage"></a>Internal Storage</h3><p>The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Lava Storm 5G device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.</p><h2 id="Reasons-Why-My-Lava-Storm-5G-is-Running-Slow"><a href="#Reasons-Why-My-Lava-Storm-5G-is-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why My Lava Storm 5G is Running Slow"></a>Reasons Why My Lava Storm 5G is Running Slow</h2><p>It’s not really hard to tell why your Lava Storm 5G is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Lava Storm 5Gs.</p><h3 id="Overloading-Background-Processes"><a href="#Overloading-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="Overloading Background Processes"></a>Overloading Background Processes</h3><p>It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Lava Storm 5G is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Running-Out-of-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Running Out of Storage"></a>Your Phone is Running Out of Storage</h3><p>Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Lava Storm 5G device. So if your Lava Storm 5G is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.</p><h3 id="Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow"><a href="#Animation-Speed-is-Way-Too-Slow" class="headerlink" title="Animation Speed is Way Too Slow"></a>Animation Speed is Way Too Slow</h3><p>You can modify the Lava Storm 5G device’s animation type and speed on your Lava Storm 5G via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Lava Storm 5G to launch an app or complete a certain process.</p><h3 id="You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version"><a href="#You’re-Using-an-Outdated-Android-Version" class="headerlink" title="You’re Using an Outdated Android Version"></a>You’re Using an Outdated Android Version</h3><p>If your Lava Storm 5G is running slow and freezing, the Lava Storm 5G device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.</p><h3 id="Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues"><a href="#Your-Phone-is-Experiencing-Some-System-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues"></a>Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues</h3><p>Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Lava Storm 5G device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Lava Storm 5G is running slow and freezing.</p><h3 id="Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable"><a href="#Your-Internet-Connection-is-Unstable" class="headerlink" title="Your Internet Connection is Unstable"></a>Your Internet Connection is Unstable</h3><p>Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Lava Storm 5G is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-When-My-Lava-Storm-5G-Lags"><a href="#What-to-Do-When-My-Lava-Storm-5G-Lags" class="headerlink" title="What to Do When My Lava Storm 5G Lags?"></a>What to Do When My Lava Storm 5G Lags?</h2><p>It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow.

So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.</p><p><strong>General Bugs And Glitches</strong></p><p>OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.</p><p><strong>Hardware Issues</strong></p><p>In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Lava Storm 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue"><a href="#Part-II-How-To-Fix-Android-Camera-Not-Working-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?"></a>Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?</h2><p>So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved?

So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.</p><p>Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg"                      alt="closing apps in app switcher"                ></p><p>Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button.

To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Camera &gt; Permissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg"                      alt="camera permissions check android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg"                      alt="set camera permissions android"                ></p><p>Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.</p><h3 id="II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache"><a href="#II-IV-Clear-The-Camera-App-Cache" class="headerlink" title="II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache"></a>II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache</h3><p>Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful.

Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Photos &gt; Storage Usage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg"                      alt="clear photo gallery app cache"                ></p><p>Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.</p><h3 id="II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates"><a href="#II-VI-Check-For-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="II.VI: Check For App Updates"></a>II.VI: Check For App Updates</h3><p>This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably.

Use the Volume and Power keys to select the “Backup &amp; Restore” option on the screen.</p><p>Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive.

Or possibly, it may freeze after getting opened thereby hampering the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/fix-unfortunately-settings-has-stopped.jpg"                      alt="unfortunately settings has stopped"                ></p><p>Well!

Hence, as the first tip, we would like you to clear the Settings cache if that is what triggers the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” issue. Clearing it would definitely make Settings run appropriately. And The steps to clear the cache of the Google Play Services app are similar. Here is how to clear the cache of Settings:</p><ol><li>Open “Settings” on your Lava Blaze Pro 5G and choose “Apps &amp; Notifications”&#x2F;”Apps”&#x2F;”Application Manager” (the option may differ on different devices).</li><li>In the list of applications, look for “Settings” and open it.</li><li>Now, select “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/clear-cache-settings.jpg"                      alt="settings crashing - clear cache"                ></p><p>Note: In some phones, the “Clear Cache” option may come after tapping on “Force Stop”.

RAM, if at the increased level, is responsible for the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device’s freezing, poor performance, and most probably is the reason behind crashing Settings. Also, if the apps in the background keep running, they might conflict with the Settings and stop it to perform properly. Therefore clearing RAM is important when Android Settings is not responding. Here is how to do it.</p><ol><li>Firstly, you need to go to the Recent apps screen. For this, long-press the Home key.<br> Note: Please note that different devices have different ways to go to the Recent apps screen. Do it according to the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device you own.</li><li>Now, swipe the apps and tap on the clear option.
