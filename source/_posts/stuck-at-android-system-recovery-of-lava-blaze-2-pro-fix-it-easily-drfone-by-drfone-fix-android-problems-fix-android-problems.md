### 4. Restart Your Device

Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Lava Blaze 2 Pro device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the **Power button**(you must press and hold both the **Power** and **Volume Up** buttons on a newer Android device).
- **Step 2:** Tap **Restart**. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.

### 5. Set Up Your Time and Date

Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Go to **System**or **General Management** (depending on your Android model).
- **Step 3:** Go to **Date and Time**.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Set Date**and set the correct date.

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

### 7. Update Your App

If your system is updated, then Spotify might need an update. The app might malfunction if you’re using an older version. Thus, updating the app might solve the Spotify crashing problem. You can update Spotify by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the **Play Store**.

![play store on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-14.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Search and open Spotify in the Play Store.
- **Step 3:** Tap Update

### 8. Free up Storage

Spotify can start crashing if your Android’s storage space is at capacity. That can also cause other apps to crash, not only Spotify. Therefore, check the storage space and free up as much as possible. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




- **Step 3:** Here, you can see how much of your storage space is available and what’s taking up the most space.

![available storage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-17.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Then, you can go ahead and clear as much space as you can.

- **Step 7:** Once it installs, log in to test if it’s working.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several websites that check real-time app servers and if they’re down.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)
