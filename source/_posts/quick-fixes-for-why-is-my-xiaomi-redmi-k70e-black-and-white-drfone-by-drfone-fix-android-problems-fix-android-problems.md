### Restart the Phone

It is a universal method to fix minor Android system issues. And here too, we would like you to restart your Xiaomi Redmi K70E in the first place when you find that Gmail is not responding due to the sluggish behavior.

Dr.Fone will now download your firmware and automatically install it onto your device. Your phone will then reset, and you’ll be ready to use it without experiencing that annoying error 920 play store code!

#### **METHOD 2: Re-installing the application**

This is the first thing that you want to try before going on to the more advanced one. In fact, this is the first thing I’d recommend you to try if you come up with an Error code 920. Just try this whenever you get any error.

Step 1 - Go to the application that you got the error with.

Step 2 - Open that application download page on the Play store.

Step 3 - Uninstall it or even uninstall all the update (If the error came when you were updating the application).

Step 4 - Now you clear the task manager and try installing it once again. If the play store error 920 doesn’t come then you have solved the problem and now wasn’t that easy. So it’s always best to try this step before doing anything else.

![error code 920-install apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022232651.jpg)

#### **METHOD 3: Switching off and turning the wifi (cellular data) on**

This is another basic method in solving the play store error 920. This error comes in when you have given too many tasks to download.

Step 1 - To remove that load Just turn your wifi off and then turn your wifi on (the same goes with your cellular data).

Step 2 - Now after doing this go to your Play Store application and download the application that you were going to download. Now your Play Store Error 920 won’t be bothering you anymore.

![error code 920-turn off wifi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022435219.jpg)

#### **METHOD 4: Clearing the cache and data of Google Play Store**

This is a little more complicated (complicated as in you will need to do a little more than the previous two methods). What you need to do is clear the cache and clear the data of the play store. This will get rid of the error code 920 the next time you download or update any application from the Google Play store.

Step 1 – Go to settings of your device.

Step 2 – Now find “Applications” option under the settings menu. Here you can find “Google Play Store” option. Open it.

Step 3 – Now, at the bottom, you can find “Clear Cache” option. Tap on it and your all cache will be cleared.

![error code 920-google play store clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022644620.jpg)

After doing this step clear your task manager (delete all recent applications). Go to play store and resume your download or update.

#### **METHOD 5: Removing and adding back your Google account**

It is best if you follow the order of the methods mentioned. Like, try each method in the given order until you get rid of the play store error 920. If you reach here then you truly must be in a desperate position to get rid of this error. The best and guaranteed way is to delete your Google account from your phone. By deleting what is meant here is to temporarily remove your account and the adding it in again. What this does is it kind of resets your play store details and it eradicates the error code 920. To do this you need to

Step 1 - go to Settings of your Mobile.

Step 2- Now, find “Accounts” and then go to “Google Accounts”.

Step 3 - In that section find the account you use for the play store or the account that you were using while the error came in. Once you tap on your specific account you’ll find an option to remove the account. Tap on it.

Step 4 - Now you have successfully removed your account and after that re-add your account. After entering your email id and password and hence adding your account. Go back to the play store and find the application that you were downloading or updating when the error code 920 came in. Now re-install it or update it back again. This time you won’t be faced with the play store error 920.

![error code 920-remove account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022914137.jpg)

Again it is best if you follow the methods as illustrated above for removing error code 920 and this might have solved your problem by now. If now, you go for a complete factory reset, do it only at the extreme stage as this will delete all your personal data.

Play Store error 920 is a pretty common error and its solutions are also very easy. Please do ensure that you follow each and every step in sync so that you can get the best result out of these methods and get over with the error code 920 on Google play store.
