Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid Oppo F25 Pro 5G Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Oppo F25 Pro 5G App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Oppo F25 Pro 5G Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data. With features such as System Repair and Data Backup & Restore, you can quickly diagnose and fix software issues that may cause unresponsiveness and safely back up important data to prevent loss in case of device damage or malfunction.

### Conclusion

Oppo F25 Pro 5G Screen unresponsiveness can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are solutions available. Force restarting the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device, checking for software updates, using Dr. Fone Repair, and contacting customer service are all effective ways to solve the problem. However, it's also important to understand the possible causes of the issue, such as soft-bricking or equipment wearing out, and take preventative measures, such as updating your phone on time and avoiding malware. These tips can help prevent Oppo F25 Pro 5G Screen unresponsiveness and keep your device running smoothly.
