Many users have reported that Chrome crashes or won’t open on their Vivo Y27s. If you are also facing this issue, then you have come to the right place. In this article, we will discuss the reasons behind this problem and provide you with 7 solutions to fix Chrome crashes or won’t open on Vivo Y27s.

Being one of the widely used browsers, Chrome is always our rescue whenever vital information is our need. Imagine, you launched Chrome for some urgent work and all of a sudden, got “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” error. You re-opened it thinking about proper functioning of it now but to no avail. Does this situation sound familiar? Are you in a same problem as well? Fret not! We will discuss in this article why your Chrome is crashing on Android and the potential solutions to do away with the problem. Please read the article attentively and know what helps you best.

## Part 1: Too many tabs opened

One of the main reasons why Chrome keeps crashing could be the multiple opened tabs. If you keep open the tabs, it may slow down the performance of Chrome and the app will use RAM. As a result, it will obviously get stopped midway. Therefore, we suggest you to close the tabs which are opened. And once you do that, exit the app and then launch it again.

## Part 2: Too much memory used

When Chrome or any other app keeps running on the background, issues like “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” are likely to occur. Moreover, the opened apps will eat the memory of your device. Hence, as the next solution, it is suggested that the Chrome should be closed by force quitting and then you need to try to launch it again to work. See if it works or still Chrome is not responding.

1\. Simply tap on the Home button twice to get on the recent apps screen. Please note that the button may vary to reach the screen. Please check once and move accordingly.

3\. The app will be force quit now. You can then start it again to check if thing get back to normal.

## Part 3: Chrome cache overflowing

While using any app for long, the temporary files for those gets collected in the form of cache. And when cache is not getting cleared, one may face the freezing, crashing or sluggish apps. And this could also be the cause why your Chrome keeps stopping. Hence, the following steps will show you how to clear cache and make Chrome work as before.

1\. Open “Settings” and go to “Apps & Notifications”.

2\. Look for “Chrome” and tap on it.

3\. Go to “Storage” and click on “Clear Cache”.

![fix Chrome crashing on Android by clearing cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/clear-cache-chrome.jpg)

## Part 4: Exclude the issue of website itself

Most probably Chrome is not able to support the website you are trying to access. We doubt if the particular website you are making use of is the culprit and making Chrome keeps stopping. In such case, we would like to recommend you to make use of another browser and try to access the website from there. See if this works or not. If now, please follow the next solution.

## Part 5: Android firmware corruption

If this is the case, the re-flashing the stock ROM is the most recommended solution.
