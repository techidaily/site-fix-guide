Leaving a Life360 Circle through the standard method may not align with your preference in certain scenarios. In such cases, there are many methods you can use to maintain your privacy without alerting fellow Circle members. Here are some strategic approaches:

### Method 1: Using an App To Spoof Your Location

One of the most effective and safe ways to trick Life360 without triggering notifications is by using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Virtual Location.

#### How To Spoof Your Life360 Circle Location Using Dr.Fone

Follow the steps below to learn **how to leave a Life360 Circle without anyone knowing** using Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location tool:



- **Step 1:** Download and install Dr.Fone, then connect your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ via USB cable. Launch the tool from **Toolbox** > **Virtual** **Location**. Click **Get Started** to proceed.

![dr.fone connecting smartphone to computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

- **Step 2:** Activate **Developer Mode** on your smartphone by following on-screen instructions in **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**. Restart the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device, unlock it, and select **Turn On**. Enter your password.

![dr.fone developer mode instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-3.png)

- **Step 3:** On the map, enter the number of movements and select **Round** or **Loop** trip. Adjust the speed, then click **Move Here** to start the simulation. **Pause** or clear to revert.

![dr.fone simulate movement with map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

![enable battery saving mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-13.jpg)

## FAQ: All you want to know about changing location on LinkedIn

### 1\. Should I change my location on LinkedIn, although I haven’t relocated yet?

If you are planning to relocate to a new place soon, updating your LinkedIn location is fine. Location update will help you target the job market and with job-seeking to get the desired job. It is suggested that suppose if you are moving to ABC location soon, you can update your LinkedIn location to ABC but at the same time mention your present current location, somewhere in the profile. Mentioning your current location will not create any feeling of being cheated or misled by the people who visit your profile.

### 2\. How do I hide my location on LinkedIn?

There is no option on LinkedIn to hide your location. You can only provide incorrect information by changing, customizing, or setting a fake location but cannot hide it. By default, Linkedin keeps your profile visible to all. You can change it by following the steps given below:

- 1\. Log in to your LinkedIn profile.
- 2\. Go to settings, click on the "Privacy" tab in the menu.
- 3\. Click on the "Edit your public profile" link.
