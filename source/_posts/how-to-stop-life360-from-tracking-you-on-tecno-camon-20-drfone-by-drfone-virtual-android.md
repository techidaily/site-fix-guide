**Step 1:** To use this, you don’t need to jailbreak or root your device until your Android is running on 6 and higher versions.

**Step 2:** Go to Play Store and search for the app. Install it after downloading.

When you install it rightly, this is how to do a little twisting to set it up with Find My Friends.

**Step 1:** To spoof people about the location, enable the developer settings in the first place. Simply head to “Settings” for this and go to “About Phone”.

**Step 2:** In the “Software Info”, you will see a build number. Tap on it nearly 6-7 times. The Developers options will be enabled now. This step is important because it will alter the security settings in your phone. As a result, tricking about the location will become easier.

**Step 3:** When developer options are enabled, launch the app. You will see an “ENABLE” option at the bottom. Tap on it to turn on mock locations feature.

**Step 4:** Under the Developer options page, click on “Select mock location app”. Now, select “FakeGPS Free” from the list.

**Step 5:** Return to Fake GPS Free and long press the two spots on map to set the route. Take help of the play button given at the bottom. This will enable the location spoofing. You will see, “Fake location engaged…”. This will show your fake location on Find My Friends app.
