Now, see whether you can find the **app icon that disappeared on your Android.** If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device.

It is easy to mistake stuck and ****dead pixels on the phone**** for one other, but they are unique issues with different causes and effects. Read on to understand the differences and how they affect your phone's display.

These ****broken pixels on the phone**** can hurt the user experience, and it is essential to know the root causes to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

- ****Manufacturing defects****. During manufacturing, some pixels may not work due to poor quality control, resulting in stuck or ****dead pixels on the phone**** In other words, if the power transfer issue isn't completely fixed, you might see more dead pixels.
- ****Physical damage****. Accidents such as dropping the phone or exposure to extreme heat or cold can damage the screen and cause stuck or dead pixels. For instance, the ****upper part of the touch screen not working****may also occur due to pressure on the display when the phone is placed in a pocket with other sharp objects.

![person holding a gadget with pen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-03.jpg)

- ****Age-related wear and tear****. Over time, the display on your phone may start to wear out, resulting in the appearance of dead or stuck pixels on the phone.

## Part 2: How To Fix Dead Infinix Note 30 Pros on Phone Screens on Android Devices

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

## Part 3: Benefits of Using Dr.Fone on Phones With Dead Infinix Note 30 Pros

If your phone's screen is malfunctioning or some features are inaccessible due to stuck or dead pixels, following the steps to ****fix dead pixels on the phone**** may be challenging. Resetting your phone and backing up data can also be a hassle.

The good thing is Dr.Fone can help you with these issues, making the process easier and more efficient. This app offers a variety of benefits and features that can help you find a quick and effective fix for your smartphone.

- ****Backup and recovery of data****. Dr.Fone offers a straightforward way to back up your vital data from iOS and Android smartphones and selectively restore specific files when needed. This feature is essential for those who have lost important files due to a phone's damage, malfunction, or accidental deletion. It allows you to recover data and avoid potential data loss.

- ****Ease of use****. The software is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it accessible to anyone without advanced technical knowledge.
- ****Safety****. The software is safe and secure, ensuring that your data is not compromised during the process. This feature is for users concerned about the confidentiality of their data and wants to ensure that their personal information is not shared or stored on the internet.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Infinix Note 30 Pros Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Infinix Note 30 Pros Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Infinix Note 30 Pros Spreading on My Infinix Note 30 Pro?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Infinix Note 30 Pros Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Infinix Note 30 Pro devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.
