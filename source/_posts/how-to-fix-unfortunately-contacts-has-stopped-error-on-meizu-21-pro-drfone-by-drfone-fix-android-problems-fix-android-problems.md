If your **app icon disappeared on your Android**, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:

- **Step 1.** Open the App Drawer on your Android. To do this, swipe from the bottom to the top, starting from your home screen. The App Drawer is where all your installed apps are neatly listed.
- **Step 2.** Once you open the App drawer, locate the app icon that has disappeared from your home screen. For example, you **lost the phone icon on Android**. Then, look for the phone icon from the App Drawer.
- **Step 3.** Long-press the Icon of the missing app and move it to the desired location on your home screen. You can drag it to an empty space or a specific folder.
- **Step 4.** Release to drop the app icon onto the home screen.

### 3\. Re-enable disabled app

**App icons can also disappear on the Android** home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as 'Freezer,' allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn't appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.

To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:

- **Step 1**. Open the Apps & Notifications on the Settings.
- **Step 2.** Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the **phone icon disappears on your Android.**
- **Step 3:** In the App Info, tap Enable.

### 4\. Reset Android to factory settings

If the previous methods don't work, you might need to do a [<u>factory reset on your Meizu 21 Pro</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html). But before doing that, it's important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.

How to reset Android to factory setting:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Android Settings.
- **Step 2:** Select Backup and Reset > Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.

Please be mindful that performing a factory reset on Android will reset your Android completely to its initial state.
