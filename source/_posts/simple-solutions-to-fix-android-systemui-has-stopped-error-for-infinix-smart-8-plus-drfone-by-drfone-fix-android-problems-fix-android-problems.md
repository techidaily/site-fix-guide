### Method 3: Downloading Anti-Virus Software

Anti-virus software works like a shield, protecting your phone from sneaky viruses and malware. Here are three recommended anti-virus apps that you should try out. They’re available on both the Google Play Store and App Store. So, regardless of what device you’re using, you’re sure to be safe with these:

- Avast Anti-virus – Mobile Security
- Norton 360: Online Security
- Bitdefender Mobile Security & Anti-virus

### Method 4: Performing a Factory Reset

A [Factory Reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html) is like a phone makeover—it wipes everything and starts fresh. But be cautious, as it erases all data!

Generally, the Factory Reset option should be in **Settings > General & Backup and reset** or under **Settings > About phone** for Android devices.

IOS devices should be under **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone**.

Remember, each method has its strengths and weaknesses. Dr.Fone is quick and effective, Safe Mode is limited but useful, anti-virus apps can protect, and a Factory Reset gives a clean slate. Try these methods to zap those viruses away!

## Part 3: Handy Prevention Tips To Avoid Future Infections

To keep your phone safe from viruses, follow these easy tips that act as a shield against potential threats.

- **Regular software updates:**Keep your phone updated with the latest software. Updates often include security patches that protect your phone from new threats.
- **Cautious downloads:**Be careful when downloading apps or files. Stick to trusted sources like Google Play Store or Apple Store. Avoid clicking on suspicious links from unknown sources.
