### 1.3 Restore Factory Settings

If force restarting won’t help you to fix the problem you are facing, it’s time to reset your Vivo T2 Pro 5G to factory settings. The factory reset on an Android device will erase all of your phone settings, third-party apps, user data, and other app data to restore your device to its original manufacturer condition or settings. It means that this can bring back your device to its normal state.

To learn how to restore factory settings, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Go to your ‘Settings” and then, go to “System”>” Advanced”>” Reset options”.

Step 2: Next, tap on “Erase all data”>” Reset phone” to factory reset on your phone. Here, you may need to enter the password or pin or pattern.

Once you are done with the above steps, restart your phone and restore your data and this might be fixed the problem for you. If not, then try the next solution.
