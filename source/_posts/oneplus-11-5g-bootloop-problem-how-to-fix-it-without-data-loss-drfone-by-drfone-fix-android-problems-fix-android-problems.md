The screen on your OnePlus 11 5G phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a OnePlus 11 5G device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on OnePlus 11 5G smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their OnePlus 11 5G 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the OnePlus 11 5G device itself**

Screens on OnePlus 11 5G devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every OnePlus 11 5G device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some OnePlus 11 5G 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the OnePlus 11 5G device unusable.

## **The common solutions to solve a OnePlus 11 5G Screen unresponsive**

Could anything be more annoying than a broken touchscreen on your OnePlus 11 5G phone? If this happens, the gadget is useless, and you won't be able to do even the simplest tasks. Even so, it's common for the screen to cease responding to touches.

Before taking the item in for repairs, see if you can figure out the problem independently. Do you want to learn the method? If the touch screens on your OnePlus 11 5G stop working, don’t panic; we'll teach you exactly what to do.

### **Solution 1: Try to restart your device**

Giving your OnePlus 11 5G a restart is one of the most common solutions if you encounter an unresponsive screen on your phone. Here’s how.

**Step 1:** Press and hold the **power button** until the screen becomes black;

### **Solution 2: Check your charging port and battery**

![xiaomi battery and charger](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/charge-your-phone.jpg)

If the battery of your OnePlus 11 5G is empty, your screen is expected to be unresponsive. To fix that, here are some easy steps for you:

1. Charge your phone.
2. Leave it for about an hour.
3. Come back to check. Turn your phone on.
4. Test if the touchscreen is now working.

### **Solution 3: Contact Customer Service**

Based on the customer’s feedback, one of the frequent issues of the OnePlus 11 5G is when the screen becomes unresponsive. These issues should not usually happen, but if you find yourself in this dilemma, a list of other solutions below will help you.

### **Solution 4: Turning on your full screen option offered by MI**
