Discovering your phone died, especially among Motorola G24 Power models, can be disheartening. Looking online for ways to **unbrick your Oneplus 8T** can take up so much of your time. The unavailability of your device can disrupt your routine and connectivity. However, unbricking is the crucial solution to regain the functionality of your Motorola G24 Power device.

This guide teaches effective methods to **unbrick your Motorola G24 Power**. The page will also discuss the early warning signs and healthy habits to prolong your Motorola G24 Power. Read below to learn more.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Motorola G24 Power device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Motorola G24 Power device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Motorola G24 Power freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.
- **Unexpected Reboots and Crashes.**Frequent and unprovoked reboots, app crashes, and system instability might point toward software inconsistencies. Similar to consistent black screens, this could eventually lead to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Motorola G24 Power Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Motorola G24 Power devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.

#### Unauthorized User Modifications

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Motorola G24 Power device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Motorola G24 Power device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Motorola G24 Power device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.

## Part 1: Understanding Stuck and Dead Motorola G24 Powers on Phone Screens

While dead and ****stuck pixels on the phone**** may seem similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Read on to discover the differences and what causes them.

### Stuck Motorola G24 Powers on Phone

A ****stuck pixel phone**** is always on, so it shows up on a touchscreen as a bright, persistent dot of red, green, blue, or white. Combinations are also possible, and although it is usually stationary, this dot occasionally flickers.

### Dead Motorola G24 Powers on Smartphones

In contrast to the stuck pixel, the dead pixel subpixels are all left unpowered, turning them off. A ****dead pixel on the phone**** is a tiny, persistent rectangle of black or white color on the part of the phone screen not working.

![stuck white pixel and dead pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-02.jpg)

### Some Differences Between Stuck and Dead Motorola G24 Powers on Phone

Stuck pixels may have less effect on the user experience than ****dead pixels on the phone**** **screen** since they still display color. But dead pixels may be more disturbing because they are either black or white.

It is easy to mistake stuck and ****dead pixels on the phone**** for one other, but they are unique issues with different causes and effects. Read on to understand the differences and how they affect your phone's display.

- ****Power****. The stuck pixel on your device always receives energy, causing it to display a specific color while the dead pixel is permanently off, resulting in a black spot on your phone screen.
- ****Possibility of repair****. You can quickly fix ****stuck pixels on the phone,****while some may even disappear on their own. However, dead pixels are more challenging to repair.
- ****Occurrence****. The stuck pixel is a common issue that often affects older or less-used displays, while dead pixels rarely appear on digital cameras and sensors.

### Factors That Contribute to Stuck and Dead Motorola G24 Powers on Mobile Devices

Stuck and ****dead pixels on phone screen****s can happen for various reasons, including manufacturing defects, physical damage, and age-related wear and tear. These ****broken pixels on the phone**** can hurt the user experience, and it is essential to know the root causes to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

- ****Manufacturing defects****. During manufacturing, some pixels may not work due to poor quality control, resulting in stuck or ****dead pixels on the phone**** In other words, if the power transfer issue isn't completely fixed, you might see more dead pixels.
- ****Physical damage****. Accidents such as dropping the phone or exposure to extreme heat or cold can damage the screen and cause stuck or dead pixels. For instance, the ****upper part of the touch screen not working****may also occur due to pressure on the display when the phone is placed in a pocket with other sharp objects.

![person holding a gadget with pen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-03.jpg)

****Step 4:**** Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing ****dead pixels on the phone****. You can use a microfiber cloth to clean your screen gently, making sure not to apply too much pressure or use any harsh chemicals that could damage the screen.

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Motorola G24 Power Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Motorola G24 Powers Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Motorola G24 Powers Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Motorola G24 Powers Spreading on My Motorola G24 Power?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Motorola G24 Powers Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Motorola G24 Power devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.

## Conclusion

You have learned the difference between a stuck and ****dead pixel on the phone****. With this knowledge, you can apply the different tools and techniques for removing ****stuck pixels on phone**** screens and how to work around dead pixels on the phone screen. Whether using software like Dr.Fone or employing manual methods such as rebooting or cleaning your device, there are various options you can try.

Remember to back up your data before attempting any fixes and to seek professional help if necessary. If you are still experiencing issues with dead pixels on your phone screen, don't hesitate to contact your device manufacturer for further assistance.

## Part IV. 8 Other Methods of Resolving Common App Downloading Issues

Here are 8 other methods to troubleshoot and resolve common app downloading problems:

### Check Internet Connection

A stable internet connection is essential for downloading apps. [<u>D</u><u>o</u> <u> an Internet signal check</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-mobile-signal-stength.html) to ensure you are connected to a reliable Wi-Fi network or have a strong mobile data signal. If the connection is weak, consider switching to a more robust network.

### Free Up Storage Space

[<u>Insufficient storage</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/fix-not-enough-icloud-storage-problem.html) on your device can hinder app installations. Navigate to the Motorola G24 Power device settings, access the **Storage** section, and clear unnecessary files or apps. Creating more space ensures a smoother download experience.
