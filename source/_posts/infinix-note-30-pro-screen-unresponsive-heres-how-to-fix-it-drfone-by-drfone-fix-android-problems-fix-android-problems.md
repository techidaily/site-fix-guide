We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem.

## What Causes A Infinix Note 30 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Infinix Note 30 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Infinix Note 30 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Infinix Note 30 Pro Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Infinix Note 30 Pro device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Infinix Note 30 Pro screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Infinix Note 30 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Infinix Note 30 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Infinix Note 30 Pro Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Infinix Note 30 Pro screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Infinix Note 30 Pro black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

6. You should also consider enabling USB debugging. This is because many solutions for a Bricked device rely on USB debugging.
7. Ensure the Custom ROM you choose can actually be used on your device model.

While installing Custom ROM can actually be a great way to customize your device, it is also the leading reason for bricked devices. Therefore ensure that you understand what you are doing when you decide to customize your device. Learn as much as you can about the process before attempting everything.
