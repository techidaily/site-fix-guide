### 2.2 Restart Android and turn on Bluetooth again

![bluetooth not working on android - restart android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/restart-Bluetooth-Android.jpg)

One of the most common solutions in technology is simply to turn it on and off again, which is the case to happen here. By restarting your device, you can clear out any problems you may be suffering from to help it get up and running again. Here’s how;

1. Turn your Vivo X100 off by holding down the Power button
2. Wait for several minutes and then turn your phone on again
3. Wait for your phone to completely power up, so you’re on the Main Menu
4. Navigate Settings > Bluetooth and then enable the setting
5. Try to connect your Bluetooth device to what you were trying to do before

### 2.3 Clear the Bluetooth cache

![android bluetooth problems - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-cache.jpg)

Every service on your Vivo X100 using a feature called a cache. This is where information is stored to help the feature run properly and give you the best experience. However, over time this can get messy and can cause problems with your Bluetooth feature.

By clearing the cache, you can restart the service and hopefully clear up any issues or problems you may be experiencing.

1. On your phone, navigate Settings > Application Manager, and you’ll see all the apps and services on your phone. Locate and select the Bluetooth service.
2. Select the Storage option
3. Tap the Clear Cache option
4. Go back of the Menu and restart your phone
5. Now turn your Bluetooth feature on and turn connecting it to your preferred device

### 2.4 Remove paired devices

![android bluetooth problems - remove paired devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-paried.jpg)

Sometimes, you may have a problem with the Vivo X100 device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your Vivo X100, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.
2. Turn Bluetooth on, and you’ll see all the connections your Vivo X100 is paired with
3. Go through these settings and remove/delete/forget every connection on your device
4. Now when you go to connect to a device using Bluetooth, repair the Vivo X100 device, enter the passcode, and use a fresh paired connection.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your Vivo X100 in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode
4. Wait a minute on the Main Menu
5. Now turn on your Bluetooth and connect it to your preferred device

### 2.6 Turn on the discoverable feature

![android bluetooth problems - discoverable feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-discoverable.jpg)

To ensure your Bluetooth can connect to other devices, it’s important to make sure you’re making your device discoverable to other Bluetooth devices. If it’s hidden, other devices won’t be able to find it, and sometimes it can bug and prevent connections.

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the Vivo X100 device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Vivo X100, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Vivo X100 from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Vivo X100 device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Vivo X100
4. If the Vivo X100 devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Vivo X100

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Vivo X100 devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Vivo X100 to the Vivo X100 device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

## Reliable User Guide to Fix Vivo X100 Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Vivo X100 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Vivo X100 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Vivo X100 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Vivo X100 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Vivo X100 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Vivo X100 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Vivo X100 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Vivo X100 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Vivo X100s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Vivo X100 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Vivo X100 device. So if your Vivo X100 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Vivo X100 device’s animation type and speed on your Vivo X100 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Vivo X100 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Vivo X100 is running slow and freezing, the Vivo X100 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Vivo X100 device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Vivo X100 is running slow and freezing.

### Your Internet Connection is Unstable

Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Vivo X100 is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.

## What to Do When My Vivo X100 Lags?

It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow. However, it can still cause some delays and inconvenience for users. So it’s really important to take action when you notice some anomalies with its speed and performance. Below are some remedies that can help you get rid of this issue.

**Note:** _please note that this method may erase all personal data on your device, so make sure [you’ve backed up your device](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) before continuing._

**Step #1** Head over to [the Dr.Fone website](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/android-repair.html) and download the Repair software for your Windows computer.

**Step #2** Once installed, open the software and select the ‘System Repair’ option from the main menu.

Dr.Fone will now download your firmware and automatically install it onto your device. Your phone will then reset, and you’ll be ready to use it without experiencing that annoying error 920 play store code!

#### **METHOD 2: Re-installing the application**

This is the first thing that you want to try before going on to the more advanced one. In fact, this is the first thing I’d recommend you to try if you come up with an Error code 920. Just try this whenever you get any error.

Step 1 - Go to the application that you got the error with.

Step 2 - Open that application download page on the Play store.

Step 3 - Uninstall it or even uninstall all the update (If the error came when you were updating the application).

Step 4 - Now you clear the task manager and try installing it once again. If the play store error 920 doesn’t come then you have solved the problem and now wasn’t that easy. So it’s always best to try this step before doing anything else.

![error code 920-install apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022232651.jpg)

#### **METHOD 3: Switching off and turning the wifi (cellular data) on**

This is another basic method in solving the play store error 920. This error comes in when you have given too many tasks to download.

Step 1 - To remove that load Just turn your wifi off and then turn your wifi on (the same goes with your cellular data).

Step 2 - Now after doing this go to your Play Store application and download the application that you were going to download. Now your Play Store Error 920 won’t be bothering you anymore.

![error code 920-turn off wifi](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022435219.jpg)

#### **METHOD 4: Clearing the cache and data of Google Play Store**

This is a little more complicated (complicated as in you will need to do a little more than the previous two methods). What you need to do is clear the cache and clear the data of the play store. This will get rid of the error code 920 the next time you download or update any application from the Google Play store.

Step 1 – Go to settings of your device.

Step 2 – Now find “Applications” option under the settings menu. Here you can find “Google Play Store” option. Open it.

Step 3 – Now, at the bottom, you can find “Clear Cache” option. Tap on it and your all cache will be cleared.

![error code 920-google play store clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022644620.jpg)

After doing this step clear your task manager (delete all recent applications). Go to play store and resume your download or update.

#### **METHOD 5: Removing and adding back your Google account**

It is best if you follow the order of the methods mentioned. Like, try each method in the given order until you get rid of the play store error 920. If you reach here then you truly must be in a desperate position to get rid of this error. The best and guaranteed way is to delete your Google account from your phone. By deleting what is meant here is to temporarily remove your account and the adding it in again. What this does is it kind of resets your play store details and it eradicates the error code 920. To do this you need to

Step 1 - go to Settings of your Mobile.

Step 2- Now, find “Accounts” and then go to “Google Accounts”.

Step 3 - In that section find the account you use for the play store or the account that you were using while the error came in. Once you tap on your specific account you’ll find an option to remove the account. Tap on it.

Step 4 - Now you have successfully removed your account and after that re-add your account. After entering your email id and password and hence adding your account. Go back to the play store and find the application that you were downloading or updating when the error code 920 came in. Now re-install it or update it back again. This time you won’t be faced with the play store error 920.

![error code 920-remove account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985022914137.jpg)

Again it is best if you follow the methods as illustrated above for removing error code 920 and this might have solved your problem by now. If now, you go for a complete factory reset, do it only at the extreme stage as this will delete all your personal data.

Play Store error 920 is a pretty common error and its solutions are also very easy. Please do ensure that you follow each and every step in sync so that you can get the best result out of these methods and get over with the error code 920 on Google play store.
