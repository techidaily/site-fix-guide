In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Vivo S17e device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Vivo S17e device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Vivo S17e device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Vivo S17e contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Vivo S17e device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Vivo S17e device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Vivo S17e is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Vivo S17e is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Vivo S17es.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Vivo S17e is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Vivo S17e device. So if your Vivo S17e is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Vivo S17e device’s animation type and speed on your Vivo S17e via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Vivo S17e to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Vivo S17e is running slow and freezing, the Vivo S17e device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

## Part 1: Any idea about the Wi-Fi authentication problem?

Wi-Fi authentication has to be done every time you wish to connect to a Wi-Fi network over your smartphone or laptop. To authenticate yourself and connect to the protected Wi-Fi network, you need to have the password of it. But if after you’re putting in the correct password and still experiencing the wifi authentication problem. Here’s what you need to know.

Authentication error occurs when the “deal” between the Wi-Fi router and device fails due to certain reasons. First, the Vivo S17e device sends the password of the network and the "connect" request in an encrypted format to the Wi-Fi router. Then, the router decrypts the password and compares the password saved on it. Now, if the password matches, it sends affirmation for the "connect" request, and then the Vivo S17e device is allowed to connect to the network.

## Part 2: Why Authentication Error Occurred when Connecting to Wifi?

There could be plenty of reasons for facing an authentication error on your device. Most of the time, it occurs whenever a Wifi router seems to malfunction. Furthermore, if your phone has been recently updated, then chances are that there could be an issue with its drivers. A security attack can also make your device malfunction as well. An unstable connection or a router blockage can also be a reason for this issue.

In this scenario, whenever you try to connect to a Wifi network (even after supplying the correct password and username), it doesn’t connect to it. Instead, it displays an authentication error occurred promptly. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to overcome the authentication problem Wifi. In the next section, we have provided three different solutions to fix the Vivo S17e Wifi problem (as it mostly happens on Android devices).

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Vivo S17e and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Vivo S17e model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.

### Check carefully for duplicate Wi-Fi names before you connect

Now, try to connect to the Wifi hotspot again. You would be able to overcome the authentication problem of Wifi.

### Change Network Security Type

It has been observed that, when we connect to Wifi, our device chooses a wrong security type. This clashes with the default security protocol of the router and authentication error occurred due to this. If your device is facing the same issue, then it can be fixed by simply changing its security type. To do this, follow these instructions:

1\. To change the security type of a network, you need to “Add the network”. If you already have the Wifi network saved, then simply forget the network by following the above-mentioned tutorial.

2\. Now, turn on your device’s Wifi and tap on the option of “Add network”. Here, you would be asked to give a network name and select the security type. To manually select it, tap on the “Security” option.

![tap on the “Security”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521984185.jpg)

3\. From here, you will get a list of various security protocols that you can pick. Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK” and save your selection.

![Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981522445076.jpg)

Now, try to connect to the network again. Most likely, it will let you fix the authentication error on your device.

### Update Android firmware to the latest

There are instances where an outdated OS version of your Vivo S17e may create a hindrance in establishing a connection between your device and the WiFi network. You need to update your Android firmware to the latest version and then check if the problem persists or not.

Step 1: Launch “Settings” of your Vivo S17e and then get into the “About Phone” option.

Step 2: Now, opt for the “System Update” option. If the update is available, get your device updated to the latest OS version.

### Restart the router and reset Android network settings

Sometimes, the WiFi router may hang up while establishing a connection and therefore, the wifi authentication problem occurs. Try restarting your Wi-Fi router and then check if your device connects successfully. If this doesn’t work, try to [reset your Android Network Settings](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html#reset).

### Bonus tip: Turn Airplane mode on/off

By simply turning on the Airplane mode (and later turning it off), you can easily fix the authentication problem Wifi most of the time. You can find a toggle button for Airplane mode on the notification bar of your phone. If you can’t find it there, then go to your phone’s Settings > Connection > More Networks and turn on the feature of “Airplane Mode”.

![go to Connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981523333039.jpg)

Let it do for a while. Afterward, turn it off and try to connect to the Wifi network again.

After following these quick and easy suggestions, you would be able to fix the Vivo S17e Wifi problem for sure. Even if you use any other Android device, then its authentication error can easily be resolved after these effective solutions. Go ahead and give these expert solutions a try and let us know about your experience as well.
