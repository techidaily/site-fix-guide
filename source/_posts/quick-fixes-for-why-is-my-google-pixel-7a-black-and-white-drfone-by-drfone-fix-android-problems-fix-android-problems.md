## How to avoid Google Pixel 7a Screen being unresponsive?

To avoid Google Pixel 7a screen being unresponsive, here are some suggestions based on the possible causes:

### Check Software Updates on Time

Make sure to regularly check for and install software updates on your Google Pixel 7a phone. These updates often include bug fixes and security patches that can help prevent issues like overheating and screen unresponsiveness.

### Check Hardware from Time to Time

Regularly inspect your phone's hardware components such as charging ports, battery, and screen for any signs of damage or wear and tear. If you notice any issues, get them fixed promptly to prevent them from causing further damage.

### Avoid extreme temperatures
