However, it may not address more complex software or hardware problems causing the blue screen issue.

## Part 6: Clean or change the LCD connector

If you're facing the Android blue screen of death issue, the issue might be related to a hardware problem. The problem can be a loose or damaged LCD connector. In this scenario, you can try cleaning or changing the connector. This method is more advanced and involves disassembling your device. That's why you need to proceed with caution and only if you're comfortable with hardware tasks.

## Part 7: Update to the latest Android version

Software problems can manifest the Android equivalent of a blue screen of death. It is usually triggered by errors or anomalies within the operating system. To address these concerns, upgrading to the most recent version of the Android OS proves effective. However, updating your device's software could introduce fresh glitches or compatibility conflicts. These steps outline the process of updating your device to the latest OS:

**Step:** Open the Settings app on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G by locating and launching it. Proceed by scrolling through the options and selecting "Software Update." In the ensuing screen, choose "Download and Install" to start a search for any available updates.

## Part 8: How to fix the Android blue screen of death by factory reset?

The Android screen of death is a very confusing issue as it freezes your device at a blue screen with no options to navigate further. In such a situation you may consider performing a Factory Reset, better known as Hard Reset as you will need to enter Recovery Mode to implement this technique. Although resting your device will wipe off all its data but you don't need to worry as Dr.Fone toolkit Android Data Extraction software can retrieve all your files and keep them safe.

Accessing Recovery Mode differs for different Android devices. Thus, we suggest that you consult your device manual to understand how to boot into Recovery Mode on your particular Android device and then follow the steps given below:

Once you are on the Recovery Screen, you will see a list of options before you, similar to the screenshot below.

![android blue screen of death-recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14997039685502.jpg "recovery mode")

Use the Volume Down button to scroll downwards and reach the "Wipe data/Factory reset" option.

Now use the power button to select it and wait for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G device to reboot automatically.

You will notice that the Android device will turn back on without getting stuck at the **Android blue screen of death**. Now you can set up your device from scratch.

## Part 9: What Should You Do if Android Still Stuck on Blue Screen?

Have you tried all the methods, and your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G is still stuck on the blue screen of death? In this case, it's important to consider the possibility of a hardware issue. Remember that hardware issues can be complex. Trying to fix things without the right expertise can result in additional harm. If you're uncertain about the next steps, it's wisest to ask for assistance from a trained professional.

The Android screen of death, especially the **Android blue screen of death**, is not a very pleasant sight and could worry you. The good news is that this problem can be fixed by you sitting at home without any technical assistance. Follow the simple and easy tips given above to reboot your device and use the Dr.Fone - Data Recovery (Damaged Device) tool to rescue your data in the most efficient and effective way, then use Dr.Fone - System Repair (Android) to repair your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G.
