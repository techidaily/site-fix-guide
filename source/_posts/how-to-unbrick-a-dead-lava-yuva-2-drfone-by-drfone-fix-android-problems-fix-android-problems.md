This guide teaches effective methods to **unbrick your Lava Yuva 2**. The page will also discuss the early warning signs and healthy habits to prolong your Lava Yuva 2. Read below to learn more.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Lava Yuva 2 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Lava Yuva 2 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Lava Yuva 2 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.
- **Unexpected Reboots and Crashes.**Frequent and unprovoked reboots, app crashes, and system instability might point toward software inconsistencies. Similar to consistent black screens, this could eventually lead to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Lava Yuva 2 Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Lava Yuva 2 devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.

#### Unauthorized User Modifications

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Lava Yuva 2 device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Lava Yuva 2 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Lava Yuva 2 device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.

### 3\. Can I Use Dr.Fone for Free?

Wondershare Dr.Fone for iOS and Android is free to download and install. You can also test the first few steps and see if the program supports your device. However, when you click the **Fix Now** button to start the repair process, you will be required to enter a valid license to activate the program.

## Conclusion

Knowing the common causes of an **unresponsive phone touchscreen** is the first step to preventing it from happening to your smartphone. While there are ways to fix it when it does happen, prevention is better than cure, as most experts say. However, if the methods outlined above don’t work, your best bet is to use a dedicated program such as Wondershare Dr.Fone for Android and iOS.

Wondershare Dr.Fone works on almost all modern smartphones today and can fix a **stop-working phone screen** within less than 10 minutes. It’s beginner-friendly and doesn’t require advanced technical know-how to use right away.
