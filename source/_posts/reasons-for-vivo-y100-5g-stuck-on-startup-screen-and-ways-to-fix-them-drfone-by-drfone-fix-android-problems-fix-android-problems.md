### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked.

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

## Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen

### Hard reboot your phone

To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting ****stuck on the startup screen**** page.

Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Vivo Y100 5G. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.

### Put your phone in recovery mode

If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.

Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Vivo Y100 5G or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.

****Step 1****: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Vivo Y100 5G/Redmi phone

A boot loop describes a process when Your Vivo Y100 5G stays stuck in a circle of rebooting. When your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen****, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.

2. How do you fix a boot loop?

When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.

For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.

3. How to prevent a boot loop?

A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle. Most issues are software-related, such as having to do a system upgrade gone wrong or a problem that doesn’t mesh. One way to prevent this is to perform a software or system upgrade constantly. Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.

If you cannot find any reason why your Vivo Y100 5G will not switch on, here are some possible reasons:

1. Your Android phone is simply frozen in power-off or sleep mode. In which case, it fails to switch itself on or wake itself up when you initiate it.
2. Your phone’s battery may be out of charge.

4. Your device is clogged up with dust and lint causing the hardware to not work properly.
