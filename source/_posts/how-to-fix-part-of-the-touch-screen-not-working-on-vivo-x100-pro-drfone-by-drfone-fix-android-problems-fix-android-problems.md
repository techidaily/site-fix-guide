In some cases, this error may occur due to conflicts or compatibility issues with the automatic app updates feature. The automatic update on your Vivo X100 Pro keeps your apps updated. Disabling this feature temporarily can help resolve the problem.

As a result, you will be able to use the Phone app without interruptions. To disable the automatic updates option on the Google Play Store, you can use the following steps:

- ****Step 1:**** Navigate to the Google Play Store app on your Vivo X100 Pro and launch it. Next, tap on the profile icon in the screen's top right corner. From the options presented, select "Settings."

- ****Step 2:**** In Settings, press "Network Preferences" to expand the option. Now, open the "Auto-update apps" settings and enable the "Don't auto-update apps" option.

### Fix 5: Clear All Apps Cache and Data

When dealing with this error, clearing the cache and data of all apps on your Vivo X100 Pro can also help. Doing this will remove any corrupt or conflicting data that might be causing the issue. This fix targets the overall app ecosystem on your device.

It intends to ensure a clean slate and potentially resolve the error. Use the following guide to clear the cache and data of all apps:

- ****Step 1:**** Access your Vivo X100 Pro's Settings and tap the "Apps" option. It will lead you to all the apps running on your phone. Here, select an app to see detailed app info.

### Fix 6: Clear SIM Toolkit Cache and Data

It is worth considering the SIM Toolkit is a potential source of the problem. The SIM Toolkit is an app that provides functionality related to your SIM card. Its functions include accessing value-added services and managing mobile network settings. Clearing the cache and data of the SIM Toolkit app can help resolve this issue. The steps you need to clear the cache and data of this app are the following:

- ****Step 1:**** On your Vivo X100 Pro, find the SIM Toolkit app. After finding it, press and hold its icon until a short menu appears. Choose "App Info" from the available options to access its settings.

![access sim toolkit settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/process-com-android-10.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** Now, you need to tap "Storage" to proceed. On the next screen, first, tap "Clear Cache" to clean the cache, and later press "Clear Data."

### Fix 7: Perform Factory Reset

If all previous fixes have been unsuccessful, performing a factory reset is also an option to resolve this issue. It is a drastic measure that can potentially address underlying software issues. However, it's important to note that a factory reset will erase the entire data and settings of your device.

So, it's crucial to back up your important files before proceeding with this fix. By doing so, you can restore your device to its original state and eliminate the error. Use the detailed guide described below to factory reset your Vivo X100 Pro:

- ****Step 1:**** Start by launching the Settings app and selecting "General Management." Here, choose "Reset," and following that on the next screen, tap "Factory data reset."

![tap on factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/process-com-android-12.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** After tapping "Factory data reset," hit the "Reset" option. Next, enter your Vivo X100 Pro PIN to confirm the process, and use "Delete All" to start the factory reset process.
