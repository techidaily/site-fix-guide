The rapid evolution of technology has transformed our smartphones into powerful devices. Presently, with just a few taps, they possess the ability to accomplish a diverse array of tasks. It has been possible due to the extensive availability of mobile applications. However, it can be incredibly frustrating when your favorite apps keep crashing repeatedly.

You're not alone if you're an Android user who encounters app crashes. This article will explore ten practical ways to fix apps that keep crashing on Android devices. We will also discuss the causes behind app crashes and how to prevent them.

## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

### Method 2: Using Safe Mode

Safe Mode is like a secret agent—it helps but with a downside. It turns off third-party apps, making your phone useful only for basic calls or texts. Use this method if any solutions in this section do not work. It’s especially handy if you use your phone before sending it to a technician. This way, you’ll learn **how you can get a virus off your phone** before actually letting a technician do it.

Generally, here’s how you can [enter Safe Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) on Android Phones. Do check with your phone manufacturer’s official manual/guides on how to enter them:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button. Wait for the power options to appear.
- **Step 2:** Tap and hold the **Power Off** button.
- **Step 3:** Tap on the prompt when you see the **Reboot to safe mode** option.

For iPhones, here’s how you can do it:

- **Step 1:** Power off your iPhone.
- **Step 2:** Hold the power button.
- **Step 3:** Hold the volume down button until you see the Apple logo.
- **Step 4:** Your phone should now be in safe mode.

### Method 3: Downloading Anti-Virus Software

Anti-virus software works like a shield, protecting your phone from sneaky viruses and malware. Here are three recommended anti-virus apps that you should try out. They’re available on both the Google Play Store and App Store. So, regardless of what device you’re using, you’re sure to be safe with these:

- Avast Anti-virus – Mobile Security
- Norton 360: Online Security
- Bitdefender Mobile Security & Anti-virus

### Method 4: Performing a Factory Reset

A [Factory Reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html) is like a phone makeover—it wipes everything and starts fresh. But be cautious, as it erases all data!

Generally, the Factory Reset option should be in **Settings > General & Backup and reset** or under **Settings > About phone** for Android devices.

![miui factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-13.jpg)

IOS devices should be under **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone**.

![ios transfer or reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-14.jpg)

Remember, each method has its strengths and weaknesses. Dr.Fone is quick and effective, Safe Mode is limited but useful, anti-virus apps can protect, and a Factory Reset gives a clean slate. Try these methods to zap those viruses away!

## Part 3: Handy Prevention Tips To Avoid Future Infections

To keep your phone safe from viruses, follow these easy tips that act as a shield against potential threats.

- **Regular software updates:**Keep your phone updated with the latest software. Updates often include security patches that protect your phone from new threats.
- **Cautious downloads:**Be careful when downloading apps or files. Stick to trusted sources like Google Play Store or Apple Store. Avoid clicking on suspicious links from unknown sources.
