## Part 1: Understanding Stuck and Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs on Phone Screens

While dead and ****stuck pixels on the phone**** may seem similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Read on to discover the differences and what causes them.

### Stuck Infinix Note 30 VIPs on Phone

A ****stuck pixel phone**** is always on, so it shows up on a touchscreen as a bright, persistent dot of red, green, blue, or white. Combinations are also possible, and although it is usually stationary, this dot occasionally flickers.

### Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs on Smartphones

In contrast to the stuck pixel, the dead pixel subpixels are all left unpowered, turning them off. A ****dead pixel on the phone**** is a tiny, persistent rectangle of black or white color on the part of the phone screen not working.

![stuck white pixel and dead pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-02.jpg)

### Some Differences Between Stuck and Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs on Phone

Stuck pixels may have less effect on the user experience than ****dead pixels on the phone**** **screen** since they still display color. But dead pixels may be more disturbing because they are either black or white.

It is easy to mistake stuck and ****dead pixels on the phone**** for one other, but they are unique issues with different causes and effects. Read on to understand the differences and how they affect your phone's display.

- ****Power****. The stuck pixel on your device always receives energy, causing it to display a specific color while the dead pixel is permanently off, resulting in a black spot on your phone screen.
- ****Possibility of repair****. You can quickly fix ****stuck pixels on the phone,****while some may even disappear on their own. However, dead pixels are more challenging to repair.
- ****Occurrence****. The stuck pixel is a common issue that often affects older or less-used displays, while dead pixels rarely appear on digital cameras and sensors.

### Factors That Contribute to Stuck and Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs on Mobile Devices

Stuck and ****dead pixels on phone screen****s can happen for various reasons, including manufacturing defects, physical damage, and age-related wear and tear. These ****broken pixels on the phone**** can hurt the user experience, and it is essential to know the root causes to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

- ****Manufacturing defects****. During manufacturing, some pixels may not work due to poor quality control, resulting in stuck or ****dead pixels on the phone**** In other words, if the power transfer issue isn't completely fixed, you might see more dead pixels.
- ****Physical damage****. Accidents such as dropping the phone or exposure to extreme heat or cold can damage the screen and cause stuck or dead pixels. For instance, the ****upper part of the touch screen not working****may also occur due to pressure on the display when the phone is placed in a pocket with other sharp objects.

![person holding a gadget with pen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-03.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Fix Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs on Phone Screens on Android Devices

In this section, you will discover step-by-step instructions on how to ****fix dead pixels on phone**** screens on Android devices.

### Option 1: Check Phone Screen Appearance

Before attempting to fix a ****dead pixel on a smartphone**** screen, it is necessary to check its appearance and ensure there is no physical damage.

****Step 1:**** Check for chips, cracks, or any other signs of damage on the screen if your ****phone touch screen is not working in some areas****. If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.

![phone with damaged screen from dropping](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-04.jpg)

****Step 2:**** If you have a screen protector or case, remove them because they can interfere with the process. This step will allow you to get a clear view of the screen and accurately assess the ****dead pixel on the phone****.

![smartphone and a screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-05.jpg)

****Step 3:**** Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the ****broken pixels on the phone****.

****Step 4:**** Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing ****dead pixels on the phone****. You can use a microfiber cloth to clean your screen gently, making sure not to apply too much pressure or use any harsh chemicals that could damage the screen.

![wiping phone screen with clean cloth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-06.jpg)

### Option 2: Restart Your Infinix Note 30 VIP

This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem. Here is how you restart most smartphones available in the market.

****Step 1:**** Press and hold down the ****power key**** on your Infinix Note 30 VIP until the ****power menu**** appears.

****Step 2:**** Select ****Restart**** on your phone's screen. It will initiate a reboot of your device.

![android interface restart and power off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-07.jpg)

**Tip:**

If your Infinix Note 30 VIP is unresponsive to the usual restart method because a ****part of the phone screen is not working****, try a forced restart by holding the ****power button**** for at least 10 seconds.

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Infinix Note 30 VIP Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

**Note:**

![safe mode on the android screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg)

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Infinix Note 30 VIPs Spreading on My Infinix Note 30 VIP?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Infinix Note 30 VIPs Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Infinix Note 30 VIP devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.

## Conclusion

You have learned the difference between a stuck and ****dead pixel on the phone****. With this knowledge, you can apply the different tools and techniques for removing ****stuck pixels on phone**** screens and how to work around dead pixels on the phone screen. Whether using software like Dr.Fone or employing manual methods such as rebooting or cleaning your device, there are various options you can try.

Remember to back up your data before attempting any fixes and to seek professional help if necessary. If you are still experiencing issues with dead pixels on your phone screen, don't hesitate to contact your device manufacturer for further assistance.
