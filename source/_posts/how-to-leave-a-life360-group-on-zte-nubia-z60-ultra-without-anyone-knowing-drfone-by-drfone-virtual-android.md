## Part 1. How To Leave a Life360 Circle

Life360 has become a household name. It’s a digital haven for families to stay connected through its “Circle.” The Circle functions as a virtual space where family members’ locations are shared. While this can be beneficial, there are times when you wish to leave a Circle for personal reasons.

### How To Leave a Life360 Circle You Created

The default method of leaving a Life360 Circle is straightforward but comes with a catch. All members within the Circle are notified when someone leaves. The notification serves as a built-in transparency feature. It keeps everyone aware of any changes in the group dynamics. Follow the steps on **how to leave Circle in Life360** when you created it yourself:

- **Step 1:** Launch the Life360 app on your device and go to **Settings**. Tap on **Circle Management** and select the Circle you intend to exit.

![life360 circle management option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Choose the option **Leave Circle**. If you were the admin, ensure that you designated a new admin before leaving. Apart from that, the process is straightforward. Follow the on-screen instructions.

![life360 leave circle option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-03.jpg)

### How To Leave a Life360 Circle You’re a Part Of

Here’s **how to leave a circle in Life360** that you’re a part of. Here are the detailed steps:

- **Step 1**: Open your Life360 on your smartphone. Log in if necessary. Tap **the Circle Switcher** located at the top of your screen. Choose the specific Circle you wish to exit. Afterward, access the **Gear** icon positioned in the upper left corner.

![leaving circle where you are member](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-04.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Choose **Circle Management** from the list. Tap on **Leave Circle** at the bottom of the screen. Confirm your decision by selecting **Yes** in the popup. You’ll no longer be associated with the Circle, and it won’t appear in your Circles list. If you wish to rejoin, you’ll need a new invitation from the Circle Admin.

## Part 2. How To Leave a Life360 Circle Without Anyone Knowing

Leaving a Life360 Circle through the standard method may not align with your preference in certain scenarios. In such cases, there are many methods you can use to maintain your privacy without alerting fellow Circle members. Here are some strategic approaches:

### Method 1: Using an App To Spoof Your Location

One of the most effective and safe ways to trick Life360 without triggering notifications is by using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Virtual Location. The tool offers a seamless solution for location spoofing with the following key features:

- **One-click location changer.**Change your location with one click.
- **Simulate GPS movement along your usual route.**Mimic your typical movements without being physically present.
- **Cross-platform compatibility.**Compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
- **Easy 3-step process.**Easy and intuitive steps for hassle-free location manipulation.

![dr.fone main window](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

#### How To Spoof Your Life360 Circle Location Using Dr.Fone

Follow the steps below to learn **how to leave a Life360 Circle without anyone knowing** using Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location tool:



- **Step 1:** Download and install Dr.Fone, then connect your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra via USB cable. Launch the tool from **Toolbox** > **Virtual** **Location**. Click **Get Started** to proceed.

![dr.fone connecting smartphone to computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

- **Step 2:** Activate **Developer Mode** on your smartphone by following on-screen instructions in **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**. Restart the ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra device, unlock it, and select **Turn On**. Enter your password.

![dr.fone developer mode instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-3.png)

- **Step 3:** On the map, enter the number of movements and select **Round** or **Loop** trip. Adjust the speed, then click **Move Here** to start the simulation. **Pause** or clear to revert.

![dr.fone simulate movement with map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

- **Step 4:** To activate **Teleport Mode**, click the **Search** bar. Type a location and hit **Enter**. Click **Move Here** to change the smartphone location on the map. Verify on your smartphone’s maps application. Once done, you spoofed a Life360 circle without anyone knowing.

![dr.fone teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The next method can serve as a last resort if using Dr.Fone is impossible. Be aware that they come with the trade-off of notifying other Circle members. Maintaining open communication within the Circle is crucial. Do these alternatives only when it’s necessary for your privacy.

### Method 2: Turning Off Mobile Data and Wi-Fi

If Dr.Fone is unavailable, a simple tactic is to disable both mobile data and Wi-Fi.

- **Step 1:** Open your device settings. Go to **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.
- **Step 2:** Disable both **mobile data** and **Wi-Fi**. Life360 will lose real-time tracking capability, but be cautious, as this may raise suspicion.

### Method 3: Switching To Airplane Mode

Another option is to activate Airplane Mode, severing all connections, including location sharing. Again, this method may alert Circle members to your departure.

- **Step 1:** Access your device settings. Look for **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.

![airplane mode interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle on **Airplane Mode**. The method severs all connections, including location sharing.

### Method 4: Turning Off Your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra

A straightforward yet noticeable method involves turning off your device. While it suspends location tracking on Life360, frequent use may draw attention.

### Method 5: Disabling Background App Refresh

In your device settings, disable **Background App Refresh** for Life360. Although this may impact location accuracy, it’s an option to consider if Dr.Fone isn’t accessible.

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

![enable battery saving mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-13.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Enable **Battery saving** or **Power saving** mode.

### Method 7: Getting a Burner Phone

Acquiring a secondary, inexpensive phone for Life360 use may be an alternative if all else fails. This method involves monetary considerations and may not be practical for everyone.

## Part 3. A Deep Dive on Life360’s Circle Feature

Life360’s Circle feature serves as the cornerstone of the app. It fosters connectivity and safety among its users. After diving into **how to leave a Circle on Life360** in the above parts, it’s time to have a comprehensive look at essential aspects of the Circle feature:

![life360 app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-14.jpg)

### Can You Remove Someone From a life360 Circle?

### How To Know if Someone Leaves the Circle?

Life360 notifies Circle members when someone leaves. The transparency feature aims to keep everyone informed about changes within the group.

### Can You Include Non-Family Members in a Circle?

While Life360 is designed for family safety, you can include non-family members in a Circle. The flexibility caters to scenarios where close friends or caregivers need to be part of the safety network.

### Is Circle Place Alerts Really That Useful?

The Circle Place Alerts feature proves valuable for users. It allows predefined locations to trigger alerts when members enter or leave those areas. While useful for safety monitoring, its practicality may vary depending on individual preferences and needs.

### What if People in the Circle Feel Micromanaged?

Knowing the feeling of being micromanaged, especially among kids and teens, Life360 introduces the Bubble feature. The Bubble feature allows users to set a custom safety zone. It balances monitoring and granting a sense of autonomy within a designated area.

## Conclusion

Leaving a Life360 Circle can be achieved through the standard method. However, it alerts other members, which can be annoying. While alternative methods exist, they often trigger notifications.

### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode. When the Ghost Mode is enabled, your location won't be shared with others. To start sharing your location, you can just turn off the Ghost Most and select with whom you wish to share your whereabouts (all or selected contacts).

This will fake your location for the Snapchat map and no one would know your actual whereabouts.

Apart from security concerns, a lot of users would like to spoof location on Snapchat to trick their friends. You can just change your location to anywhere in the world and make your friends believe that you are visiting that place for fun.
