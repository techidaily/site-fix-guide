Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to.

**Social Media**

Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.

This is one of the easiest software options to use for spoofing current locations without actually moving around. This app works over other apps and also comes with an easy-to-use joystick feature that you can use to control your location when not in the app.

**Key Features**:

- Allow device-only and GPS-only permission on.

- Geotag location taken in another location without having to move now.
- Set personalized routes.

**Method 2. [Mock Locations](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.gavrikov.mocklocations)**

Android users can try out the Mock Locations application to spoof their GPS tracker for fake locations on different apps on the phone. It helps change the location coordinates of the user that Network and GPS service providers typically track.

Instead, while using this app, you can set up start and end points for your route on a map and automatically start creating a route between the points.

**Key Features**:

- Set brakes before any bend in the route.

**Cons**:

- Speed can fluctuate.
- Bugs can occur when users keep it active for longer periods non-stop.

**How to use it?**

**Step 1:** Install the app and launch it. Give app access permissions.

**Step 2**: Long-tap points on the map to mark starting and ending locations. The app will automatically start evaluating suitable routes.
