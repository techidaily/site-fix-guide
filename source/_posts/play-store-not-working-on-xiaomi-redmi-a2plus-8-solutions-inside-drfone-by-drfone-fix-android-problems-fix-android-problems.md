### Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache

If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason.

And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.

Here is how to clear Google Play Services cache:

### Method 7. Boot into download mode to clear cache of whole phone

This is an advanced method to solve issues and is helpful when the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device is facing any flaws or malfunctions. For this, you need to go to the download mode or recovery mode of your device. Every device has its own steps for this.

- On the recovery screen, use the “Volume” buttons for scrolling up and down and go to “Wipe cache partition”.
- To confirm, press the “Power” button. Now, the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device will begin to wipe the cache.
- Hit reboot when asked and the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device will now be rebooted finishing the issue.

### Method 8. Check your Android storage

### Method 9. battery optimization

Some devices aggressively optimize battery usage, which can interfere with the background processes required for updating Google Play Services. Disable battery optimization for Google Play Services in the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device's Settings to ensure uninterrupted updates.
