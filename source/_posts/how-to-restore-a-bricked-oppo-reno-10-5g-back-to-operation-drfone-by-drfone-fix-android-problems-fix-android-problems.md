## Part 4: Android Phone Won't Turn On: **Common Fix**

To try fixing an Android Phone that won’t turn on, follow these steps:

1. For any Android devices, remove the battery (considering the battery of your Oppo Reno 10 5G can be removed) and leave it out for at least 30 minutes. Put back the battery in and try to turn it on.
2. Press and hold down the **Power** and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time for 15-30 minutes to reboot the Oppo Reno 10 5G device.
3. Should the first two steps do not work, charge your Oppo Reno 10 5G to get it out of the start-up loop. You can also opt to use a different battery, just in case your current battery is the source of the problem.
4. If there are any connected hardware e.g. SD card, remove them from the Oppo Reno 10 5G device.
5. Start your Oppo Reno 10 5G in **Safe Mode** by pressing and holding down the **Menu** or **Volume Down** button on your device.
6. Should the first five steps do not work for you, perform a hard reset. Do take note that each device will have a different way to do so and that data that is stored locally on the phone will be deleted.
7. Send your Oppo Reno 10 5G to the repair shop should none of these steps work.
