It is not uncommon for **phones** to be ****stuck on the startup screen****, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.

### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate.

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

1. What is a boot loop?

A boot loop describes a process when Your Vivo Y02T stays stuck in a circle of rebooting. When your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen****, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.

Since there is an issue with the booting process, it will keep running into the same error repeatedly, calling the boot loop. When trapped in a boot loop, your device will keep turning off and on. Most boot loop issues are software-related, such as a wrong system update.

3. How to prevent a boot loop?

A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle.
