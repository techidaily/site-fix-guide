To restart a Honor Play 7T device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Honor Play 7Tlogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Honor Play 7T device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Honor Play 7T device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Honor Play 7T device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Honor Play 7T device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Honor Play 7T device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Honor Play 7T Y2 and Honor Play 7T 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Honor Play 7T device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.
- To clear the cache, select **Clear Cache**.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Honor Play 7T device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Honor Play 7T device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Honor Play 7T device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Honor Play 7T Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

- Open the **Settings**.
- Navigate to the A**dditional settings** section of the Honor Play 7T Redmi 5A settings.
- Please scroll down the screen until you reach the **Backup & reset** option, then click to access it.
- Click**Erase all data (factory reset)** to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Honor Play 7T Redmi 5A.
- Select **All files on the phone**to make a complete format of the Honor Play 7T Redmi 5A.
