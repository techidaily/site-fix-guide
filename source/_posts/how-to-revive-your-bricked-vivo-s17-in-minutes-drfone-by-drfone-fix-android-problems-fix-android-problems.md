### 3.6 Try another Google account

If you’re unable to see a streak of hope and wondering why my **_Play Store is still showing download pending_**. Well, some unexpected issue might be there with your Google account. As, there are times where your existing Google account can be the hurdle. Therefore, trying your hand in some other Google account might assist to work things out.

### 3.7 Avoid downloading large apps

Last but certainly not the least, users must avoid downloading large applications. Especially those games that eats a whopping number of 300+MB of your space. You must always watch out on size of the application is and only then craft the decision to load it on your device. This may help out in keeping the **_Play store stuck on downloading_** problem at bay.
