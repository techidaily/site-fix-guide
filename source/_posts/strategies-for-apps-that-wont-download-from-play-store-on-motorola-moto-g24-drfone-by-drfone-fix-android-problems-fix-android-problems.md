## Part 4: Boot into Safe Mode to fix Android boot loop

![boot into safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/boot-loop-android.jpg)

Booting your Motorola Moto G24 into Safe Mode is a useful troubleshooting step to fix boot loop issues caused by third-party apps. When in Safe Mode, the Motorola Moto G24 device will start up with only essential system apps, and any downloaded apps that might be causing conflicts won't run. Here's how you can boot your Motorola Moto G24 into Safe Mode to address the boot loop problem:

**Step 1: Power Off Your Device**

Hold down the power button until it turns off completely.

**Step 2: Access Safe Mode**

To enter Safe Mode, follow these steps based on your device model:

- For most Android devices: Press and hold the power button to turn on your device. As soon as the manufacturer's logo appears, press and hold the Volume Down button until the Motorola Moto G24 device finishes booting. You should see "Safe Mode" displayed in the bottom left or right corner of the screen.
- Some devices might require slightly different key combinations. Refer to your device's user manual or perform an online search for the specific method to enter Safe Mode for your model.

**Step 3: Observe the Motorola Moto G24 device**

Once your device has booted into Safe Mode, use it for a while to see if the boot loop issue persists. If the boot loop doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a third-party app.

**Step 4: Identify and Uninstall Problematic Apps**

Now that you're in Safe Mode, it's time to identify the troublesome app. Start by uninstalling recently installed apps one by one until the boot loop problem is resolved. After each uninstallation, restart your device normally to check if the boot loop still occurs. Continue this process until you find the problematic app.

**Step 5: Restart Normally**

Once you've identified and uninstalled the problematic app, restart your device normally to exit Safe Mode. Your Android device should now start up without getting stuck in a boot loop.

By following these steps and using Safe Mode to isolate problematic apps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve boot loop issues on your Motorola Moto G24.

## Part 3: Useful Tips to avoid Bricking your Android Phone

If you are planning on installing custom ROM you need to install Custom Recovery. This will enable you restore the Motorola Moto G24 device to its original settings should anything go wrong and hopefully help you avoid bricking your device.

1. Ensure that you are familiar with the Fastboot or ADB commands before doing anything. You should know how to recover your device by flashing a command line and also manually transfer important files to your device.
2. Make a backup of your device. This is obvious but most people fail to adhere to it. At the very least you can get back all your files and settings to transfer to a new phone.
3. Keep a full Nandroid backup on your phone
4. Keep another backup on your PC which you can access should anything go wrong with the Custom ROM installation
5. Know how to hard reset your device. It may come in handy when your device freezes on you.
6. You should also consider enabling USB debugging. This is because many solutions for a Bricked device rely on USB debugging.
7. Ensure the Custom ROM you choose can actually be used on your device model.

While installing Custom ROM can actually be a great way to customize your device, it is also the leading reason for bricked devices. Therefore ensure that you understand what you are doing when you decide to customize your device. Learn as much as you can about the process before attempting everything.
