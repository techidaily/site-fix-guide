## Reliable User Guide to Fix Meizu 21 Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Meizu 21 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Meizu 21 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Meizu 21 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Meizu 21 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Meizu 21 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Meizu 21 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Meizu 21 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Meizu 21 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Meizu 21s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Meizu 21 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Meizu 21 device. So if your Meizu 21 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Meizu 21 device’s animation type and speed on your Meizu 21 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Meizu 21 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Meizu 21 is running slow and freezing, the Meizu 21 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Fix 5: Update All Apps on your Device

Updating the apps is crucial for any Android device to work with high efficiency and performance. Apps are developed to make the users' daily tasks easy to execute. However, there might be some negligence in the development, which can leave some bugs in the app. These bugs are fixed with time by releasing the new version of the app. To update your Android app, proceed with the following step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1:** Locate the Play Store from the Android home screen and access it. Then, tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner and proceed to the “Manage apps and devices” option. Afterward, you can check how many app updates are available from the “Updates available” option. To update the apps, you will have to go inside this option.

![choose the updates available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-process-system-not-responding-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can tap on the “Update All” button if you want to update all the apps one by one. Otherwise, you can press the “Update” option adjacent to each app name to update the frequently used ones.

### Fix 6: Check the SD card

If you are still getting the **process system isn’t responding** to Android error, then chances are that there could be an issue with your SD card. Firstly, check if your SD card is working fine or not. If it is corrupted, then get another memory card for your phone. Also, it should have a prominent amount of free storage. You might be facing this issue if the SD card has limited free space.

Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.

### Fix 9: Unroot the Meizu 21 device

It has been further discovered that the process system isn’t responding error is more common in rooted devices. Therefore, if you also have a rooted Android device, then you can choose to unroot it in order to fix this issue. There are different ways to unroot an Android device. One of the easiest ways to do it is by using the SuperSU app.

You can always download either SuperSU or SuperSU Pro app from its website [here](https://supersuroot.org/). Simply install it on our device and launch it whenever you wish to unroot it. Visit its “Settings” tab and select the option of “Full unroot”.

![continue unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671247132.jpg)

If you are using an older version of Android, then you might get another pop-up to restore boot images. Simply make the desired selection and start the process. After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.
