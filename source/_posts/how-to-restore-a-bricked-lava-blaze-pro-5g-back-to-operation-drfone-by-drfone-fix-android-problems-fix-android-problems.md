## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Step 3: If the phone isn’t charging normally, ensure the charging port isn’t clogged with dust and debris by checking and cleaning it. You can gently blow out any debris in the charging port or use a wooden toothpick to pry it open.

Step 4: After you’re done with the cleaning, it’s best to charge the phone for at least 10 minutes. Just give it a quick charge and then try to restart it.

Step 1: To get started, take the phone apart by starting at the back.

Step 2: After 20 to 30 seconds, take out the battery and put it back in.

Note: When replacing the battery, ensure the metal contacts correctly connect to the phone.

This easy and straightforward method should help you fix your Android screen black issue, but if it doesn’t, continue reading, as this article got more techniques you can try.

### 3.5 Recharge the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device

If your Lava Blaze Pro 5G screen suddenly goes black, let the battery die completely. Then once the battery is completely dead, you should plug it in to charge and turn it on by pressing the Power button. Try to check if you still encounter the issue after doing so.

### 3.6 Wipe cache partition to fix black screen of death

If your Lava Blaze Pro 5G turns on, but the screen remains black, clearing the cache partition should solve the problem. After all, keeping caches on your phone would cause it to run more slowly and cause other problems. Therefore, the issue can be resolved by clearing the cache partition. Check the following steps on how to do this below:

Step 1: Turn off your Lava Blaze Pro 5G.

Step 2: Boot the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device into Recovery Mode.

Note: The steps necessary to enter recovery mode will vary depending on your specific Android phone model. To ensure you’re doing the correct steps for your device, consult the user manual or look it up online. The following instructions work for Lava Blaze Pro 5G devices:

- **For older Lava Blaze Pro 5G devices with the home button**: Press and hold the Volume Up button, the Power button, and the Home buttons simultaneously.
- **For newer Lava Blaze Pro 5G devices without the home button**: Press and hold the Volume Up button and the Power button together.
- If the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device logo appears, release your grip, and the phone will restart.

Step 3: Find the **Wipe cache partition** option using the volume controls after entering Recovery Mode.

![wipe cache partition android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/android-black-screen-of-death-2.jpg)

Step 4: Select **Wipe cache partition** by pressing the Power button.

Step 5: On the next screen, use the Volume Down button to highlight "Yes" and then press the Power button to confirm the cache wipe.

Step 6: The cache partition will be wiped, and you will see the "Cache wipe complete" message on the screen.

Step 7: Use the Volume Down button to navigate to the "Reboot system now" option and press the Power button to reboot your Lava Blaze Pro 5G device.

After rebooting, you can see that you have successfully got rid of the annoying Android black screen of death. For most of the cases, this method solves the problem. If not, you have to move to the next method.

### 3.7 Uninstall incompatible apps

Android screen black can be a result of installing a bug or incompatible apps. If you have recently installed an app that crashes frequently, that may be the reason for the issue. Uninstalling the app from the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device may solve the problem with ease. For doing this, you need to boot your device in Safe mode. Follow the below steps.

Step 1: Power down your device by pressing and holding the Power button until a menu appears.

Step 2: Navigate to Safe Mode by pressing and holding the Power Off button.

Step 3: Tap the “Safe mode” icon to enter Safe mode. You should now see Safe Mode at the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device’s bottom.

Step 4: After selecting Settings, head to the Apps section.

Step 5: Select the app by clicking on it; the App Info window should appear. To uninstall the app, tap the Uninstall option from the menu below the screen.

![uninstall app on android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-a-black-screen-on-android-phones-05.jpg)

Step 6: Now restart the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device by pressing the power button and let it boot up in normal mode.

If the app is the reason for Android black screen of death, then after uninstalling, you can get rid of this issue. If not, now you have to factory reset your device to solve the problem.

### 3.8 Reboot to safe mode

Even after multiple attempts to launch them, certain applications act suspiciously and cause the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device to crash. When an Android phone suddenly goes black, you can often isolate the problem to a specific app by booting into Safe mode.

Step 1: Begin by restarting your phone. To do that, press the Power button until a menu appears.

Step 2: Press the Power Off button to enter Safe mode.

Step 3: Activate Safe mode by clicking the “Safe Mode” icon.

![enter android in safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-a-black-screen-on-android-phones-06.jpg)

Step 4: To return to Normal mode, turn off your device and then turn it back on.

### 3.9 Factory reset to fix Android black screen of death

The factory reset is the option that enables the factory state of your device by erasing all data, settings, bugs, and apps. Your device will be fresh like factory condition after this reset. Worth mentioning here, you’ll lose all the internal data and installed apps after this reset. So, to overcome the Android tablet black screen of death, you must perform this action as the last option. Follow the below steps carefully.

Step 1: Turn off the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device. Then press the Volume Up + Power button + home button (or press Volume Up + Power buttonS) altogether and let the mobile boot into recovery mode.

Step 2: After booting up in recovery mode, you can find the "Factory data reset" option. Navigate to that option with the volume up and down arrow and select it with the power button.

![Factory data reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/06/14987030401463.jpg)

Step 3: In this step, you need to confirm your action by tapping on the “Yes” option. After this, your device will start erasing. This may take a while to complete the whole process.

Now, your device will reboot automatically and you can see the Android black screen of death problem is solved.
