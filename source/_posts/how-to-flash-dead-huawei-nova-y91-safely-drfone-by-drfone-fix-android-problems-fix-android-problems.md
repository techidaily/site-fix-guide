“**Can’t take screenshots due to security policy**” is a screenshot restriction on your Android smartphone. You’ve probably seen this error message before, especially when taking screenshots of banking or video streaming apps. But why do apps and websites block screenshots? It’s actually for your good.

Screenshots can be misused to steal money or pirate copyrighted content. By prohibiting screenshots, apps and websites can help to protect your data and privacy. If you want to learn more, keep reading. This article will explain why apps and websites prevent screenshot capture and why it’s important for security. We’ll also give you tips on how to take photos of apps and websites that don’t let you take screenshots.

## Part 1. Can’t Take Screenshots Due to Security Policy on Android? Here’s Why

Why can’t you take a screenshot of something on your phone and get the error message that says, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**”? Apps and websites turn off or remove the screenshot feature for a variety of reasons, including:

Device Restrictions

Lots of workplaces and schools have rules against taking screenshots on devices used for work or school. Organizations do this to protect sensitive information and prevent data breaches.

Protect Sensitive Information

Say you’re trying to take a screenshot on your Huawei Nova Y91 device, and you get the notification “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy.” Huawei Nova Y91** smartphones are not necessarily the problem.

Some apps and websites, such as banking apps, store private data like financial and credit card details. Blocking capturing screenshots is a way to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.

Follow Regulations

Some industries and organizations have regulations that need them to protect sensitive data. Financial institutions must protect their customers’ financial information, for example. Disabling screenshots is one way to follow these regulations.

DRM-Protected Content

**Android can’t take screenshots due to security policy**, especially to prevent piracy. Piracy is the distribution of copyrighted material without permission. It can harm businesses that depend on copyright protection.

To prevent this, you can use DRM (digital rights management) to protect copyrighted content. DRM-protected content cannot be screenshotted or copied.

Prevent Fraud

Scammers and other criminals often use screenshots to commit fraud. For instance, people might send fake screenshots to trick others into sharing personal details or money. Disabling screenshots can help to prevent this type of fraud.

Protect Intellectual Property

Many businesses and organizations have valuable information they want to keep safe, such as trade secrets. Disabling screenshots can be helpful to prevent the theft of this intellectual property.

Protect User Privacy

Some apps and websites allow users to share private information. Some apps, like messaging apps, let users share private info. But there are limits.

You **can’t take screenshots due to security policy Whatsapp** features, View Once media option. This method stops people from taking pictures of private media chats, protecting users’ privacy.

You Are Using a Secure Folder

Companies design secure folders to protect your most sensitive data from unauthorized access, so screenshots are not allowed within them.

## Part 2. 8 Ways To Take Screenshots When You Can’t Due to Security Policy

If you’re trying to take a screenshot of an app or website with a security policy in place, there’s usually no way to circumvent it. However, there are a few things you can do to take pictures of these apps and website content.

- **Step 3:** Enable **Huawei Nova Y91 capture**.

![enable samsung capture](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-06.jpg)

Once you have enabled screen capture, you can check if you can take screenshots of any app or website.

Enable Screenshots in Incognito Mode

Apps and websites may prohibit screenshots in incognito mode to protect your privacy. However, you can enable the Incognito Screenshot experimental flag in Chrome to bypass this restriction.

- **Step 1:** Open Chrome on your Huawei Nova Y91 and type “chrome://flags” in the address bar.

![chrome experimental flags](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-07.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Search for Incognito Screenshot and choose **Enabled** from the drop-down menu.

![incognito screenshot enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-08.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Tap **Relaunch** on the lower right corner of the screen.

Once Chrome has relaunched, you should be able to take screenshots in incognito mode by pressing the power and volume-down buttons at the same time.

Use Google Assistant

![google assistant command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-09.jpg)

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy
- Screenshot Tile
- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device

If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Huawei Nova Y91 device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

Smart View allows you to display your Huawei Nova Y91 device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **Smart View** icon.
- **Step 3:** Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap **Start Now**.

![cast samsung phone using smart view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-10.jpg)

Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Huawei Nova Y91 Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.

Use Disable Flag Secure Magisk Module
