## Part 2: How to Fix Your Bricked Android Phone

Android devices are usually very flexible in allowing users to flash ROM but sometimes an incorrect process can result in a bricked device. While there are few solutions to this problem, here are a few things you can do;

### When the Sony Xperia 1 V device Boots Straight into Recovery

If the Sony Xperia 1 V device can boot to the recovery screen, you can find an alternative ROM to install and copy it your device. Installation can then be done in the recovery menu. If the Sony Xperia 1 V device is booting to recovery mode there is a chance that it can be fixed.

Step 1: Load up Clockworkmod or any other recovery tool that you have been using.

Step 2: Once you are in, navigate to the “Reboot system now.” If you are using Clockworkmod, this should be your first option. Hopefully everything will work just right if you do this, If it doesn’t you may need to download and re-flash the ROM again.

### When the Sony Xperia 1 V device won’t stop rebooting

Here’s what to do if the Sony Xperia 1 V device wont stop rebooting.

Step 1: Turn off the Sony Xperia 1 V device and then reboot in recovery mode.

Step 2: Go to “Advanced” which will bring up a number of options to choose from.

Step 3: One of the options should be “Wipe Dalvik cache” select this option and then follow the instructions. When finished select “Go Back” to return to the main menu.

![bricked android phone data recovery-Wipe data/ factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/fix-bricked-android-03.jpg)

Step 6: Finally reboot the Sony Xperia 1 V device by selecting “Reboot system now.” This should fix the problem. You may also want to flash the same ROM or try a new one.

If the above methods don’t work, try one of the following options.

You can return to resource where you found the flash tools and search or ask for advice

Sometimes these errors can be caused if the ROM installation was performed via SD card. In this case reformatting the SD card might help.

If all else fails, it is time to returning the Sony Xperia 1 V device to the vendor if your warranty is still applicable.

## Part 3: Useful Tips to avoid Bricking your Android Phone

If you are planning on installing custom ROM you need to install Custom Recovery. This will enable you restore the Sony Xperia 1 V device to its original settings should anything go wrong and hopefully help you avoid bricking your device.

1. Ensure that you are familiar with the Fastboot or ADB commands before doing anything. You should know how to recover your device by flashing a command line and also manually transfer important files to your device.
2. Make a backup of your device. This is obvious but most people fail to adhere to it. At the very least you can get back all your files and settings to transfer to a new phone.
3. Keep a full Nandroid backup on your phone
4. Keep another backup on your PC which you can access should anything go wrong with the Custom ROM installation
5. Know how to hard reset your device. It may come in handy when your device freezes on you.
6. You should also consider enabling USB debugging. This is because many solutions for a Bricked device rely on USB debugging.
7. Ensure the Custom ROM you choose can actually be used on your device model.

While installing Custom ROM can actually be a great way to customize your device, it is also the leading reason for bricked devices. Therefore ensure that you understand what you are doing when you decide to customize your device. Learn as much as you can about the process before attempting everything.
