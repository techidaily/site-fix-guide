## What Causes A OnePlus 12 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a OnePlus 12 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of OnePlus 12 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, OnePlus 12 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A OnePlus 12 Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of OnePlus 12 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue.

### 1. Restart The Device

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the OnePlus 12 black screen problem.
