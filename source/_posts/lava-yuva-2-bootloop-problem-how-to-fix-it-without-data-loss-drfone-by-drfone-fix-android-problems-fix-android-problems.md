### Device Compatibility Issues

Outdated system software can create compatibility issues, causing app instability. Ensure your device’s system software is up-to-date. Check for and install any pending system updates in your device’s settings.

If the problems persist, contacting Pandora support or seeking professional assistance might be advisable to delve deeper into the technical aspects of the app’s performance issues.

## Part 3: What To Do if None of the Fixes Work

- **Consider trying other music streaming apps.**Explore alternative music streaming applications available on the Google Play Store. Several reliable options offer similar services to Pandora, providing an opportunity to continue enjoying music while bypassing the persistent app issues.
- **Contact customer support.**Reach out to Pandora’s customer support for tailored assistance. They may offer specific troubleshooting steps or insights into the app’s technical glitches.
- **Consider a new phone.** Upgrade to a new phone if the crashes persist despite troubleshooting, and your device is outdated or incompatible. This might help resolve the issue by providing a more stable environment for app usage.

## Conclusion
