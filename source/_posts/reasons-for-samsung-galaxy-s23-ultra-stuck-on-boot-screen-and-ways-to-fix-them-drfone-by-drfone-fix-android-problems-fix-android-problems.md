### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra functioning properly.

### 3.7 Uninstall incompatible apps

Android screen black can be a result of installing a bug or incompatible apps. If you have recently installed an app that crashes frequently, that may be the reason for the issue. Uninstalling the app from the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device may solve the problem with ease. For doing this, you need to boot your device in Safe mode. Follow the below steps.

Step 1: Power down your device by pressing and holding the Power button until a menu appears.

Step 2: Navigate to Safe Mode by pressing and holding the Power Off button.

Step 3: Tap the “Safe mode” icon to enter Safe mode. You should now see Safe Mode at the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device’s bottom.

Step 4: After selecting Settings, head to the Apps section.

Step 5: Select the app by clicking on it; the App Info window should appear. To uninstall the app, tap the Uninstall option from the menu below the screen.

### 3.9 Factory reset to fix Android black screen of death

The factory reset is the option that enables the factory state of your device by erasing all data, settings, bugs, and apps. Your device will be fresh like factory condition after this reset. Worth mentioning here, you’ll lose all the internal data and installed apps after this reset. So, to overcome the Android tablet black screen of death, you must perform this action as the last option. Follow the below steps carefully.

Step 1: Turn off the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device. Then press the Volume Up + Power button + home button (or press Volume Up + Power buttonS) altogether and let the mobile boot into recovery mode.

Step 2: After booting up in recovery mode, you can find the "Factory data reset" option. Navigate to that option with the volume up and down arrow and select it with the power button.
