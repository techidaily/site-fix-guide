## Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android

In this segment, we will discuss solutions to the problem if all your Apps won't open. They are simple and easy to follow and solve the error in no time.

1\. Android updates

Firstly, it is very important to keep your Android software updated at all times as an old Android version might not support new Apps or updated Apps.

To update your software:

• Visit “Settings” and keep going downwards.

• Now select “About Phone”.

• From the options available on the screen, tap on “System Updates"

![tap on “System Updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184697337.jpg)

• In this step, if you are prompted for an update, follow the instruction given and do so.

Updating your Android software solves most of your problems. This method might sound weird but works wonders when it comes to App related issues.

2\. Restart the phone

Restarting your Realme Narzo 60x 5G to fix an error might sound old school but it gives good results when your Apps won't open. Restarting your phone is fairly simple. All you need to do is:

• Long press the power button.

• Now click on “Restart”.

![click on “Restart”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184913200.jpg)

Your phone will automatically restart and once it does, you can try to launch the App. You may also restart your Realme Narzo 60x 5G by pressing the power button for about 15-20 seconds.

3\. Reset Factory Settings

This method is a little tedious and must be last on your list. Also, make sure you take a backup of all your data and contents stored on your Realme Narzo 60x 5G and this solution will completely wipe off your phone making as good as a new smartphone.

To Factory Reset your Realme Narzo 60x 5G, carefully follow the guidelines given below:

• Visit “Settings” to find the “Backup and reset” option as shown in the screenshot below.

![Backup and reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984185141857.jpg)

• Now click on “Factory Data Reset”>“Reset Device”>“Erase Everything”

![Erase Everything](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984185334400.jpg)

Your phone will now reboot and will be required to set up from scratch.

“Why Won’t my App open” is a question asked by many Android phone users who fear that the problem occurs due to a virus attack or a system failure. However, this is not the case. The reason for the error to the surface is quite minor and can be fixed by you, sitting at home, without resorting to any kind of technical or external assistance. The solutions listed above are easy to understand and not very time-consuming.

So go ahead and try them out now!
