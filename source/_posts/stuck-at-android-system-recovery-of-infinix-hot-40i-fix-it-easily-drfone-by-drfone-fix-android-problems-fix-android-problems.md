## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Infinix Hot 40i device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Infinix Hot 40i device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Infinix Hot 40i device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Infinix Hot 40i contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Infinix Hot 40i device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Infinix Hot 40i device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Infinix Hot 40i is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Infinix Hot 40i is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Infinix Hot 40is.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Infinix Hot 40i is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Infinix Hot 40i device. So if your Infinix Hot 40i is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Infinix Hot 40i device’s animation type and speed on your Infinix Hot 40i via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Infinix Hot 40i to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Infinix Hot 40i is running slow and freezing, the Infinix Hot 40i device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Infinix Hot 40i device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Infinix Hot 40i is running slow and freezing.

### Your Internet Connection is Unstable

## Part 2: How to Fix Android Process Not Responding? 8 Fixes

When this error occurs, it can disrupt the normal operation of the Infinix Hot 40i device, causing apps to freeze or crash. Fortunately, there are several effective methods to address this problem.

### Fix 1: Restart your device

This is one of the easiest ways to resolve the **process system not responding** error. If you are getting this error on your phone, then try to manually restart your device. The way to restart your phone might differ from one device to another. Mostly, it can be done by long-pressing the power button. This will provide different power options. Tap on the “Reboot” one to restart your phone.

### Fix 2: Reset App Preferences

Sometimes the apps interfere with the Infinix Hot 40i device's settings because they were given permission to access specific functions. It is recommended to allow the asked permission precisely because some suspicious apps can also steal your sensitive data. Here are the straightforward instructions you need to follow to reset the app preferences:

Proceed to the “Apps and Notifications” settings from the Settings app. Next, tap the “See All Apps” option and access the “Three Dots” menu. Here select the “Reset App Preferences” option and confirm the process from the confirmation pop-up.

### Fix 3: Free Up Space to Make Sure Android Have Enough Internal Memory

In case the Android internal memory is completely filled, it will slow down the processing speed of the Infinix Hot 40i device. Internal memory is vital for the Infinix Hot 40i device to run all the background apps or the process required by the OS to run the Infinix Hot 40i device efficiently. You can follow these steps to free up some space on your Infinix Hot 40i:

**Step 1:** Open the Settings app on your Infinix Hot 40i and access the “Battery and Device Care” option by scrolling down. Next, tap on the “Three Dots” from the top right corner and choose the “Storage Booster” feature.

![choose the storage booster option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-process-system-not-responding-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Following this, you can select the data you want to remove from the internal memory. Your device will show the space it will free up for you, and you can press the “Free Up” button to free up the storage.

### Fix 4: Enter Safe Mode to Uninstall Suspicious Apps

This issue can also occur if you have installed an app from the Google Play Store with a very low rating or an APK. Unlike Apple App Store, anyone can easily upload their mobile apps on Play Store, so it is important to check the app's credibility before installing it. Following are the simplified instructions to enter the safe mode and delete all suspicious applications:

Press and hold the “Power” button of your Android and press and hold the “Power Off” option to access the “Safe Mode” feature. Afterward, confirm to enter the safe mode and remove all the suspicious apps from the Infinix Hot 40i device. You can do this by holding on to the app and selecting the “Uninstall” option from the pop-up options.

![turn on the safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-process-system-not-responding-4.jpg)

### Fix 5: Update All Apps on your Device

Updating the apps is crucial for any Android device to work with high efficiency and performance. Apps are developed to make the users' daily tasks easy to execute. However, there might be some negligence in the development, which can leave some bugs in the app. These bugs are fixed with time by releasing the new version of the app. To update your Android app, proceed with the following step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1:** Locate the Play Store from the Android home screen and access it. Then, tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner and proceed to the “Manage apps and devices” option. Afterward, you can check how many app updates are available from the “Updates available” option. To update the apps, you will have to go inside this option.

![choose the updates available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-process-system-not-responding-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can tap on the “Update All” button if you want to update all the apps one by one. Otherwise, you can press the “Update” option adjacent to each app name to update the frequently used ones.

### Fix 6: Check the SD card

If you are still getting the **process system isn’t responding** to Android error, then chances are that there could be an issue with your SD card. Firstly, check if your SD card is working fine or not. If it is corrupted, then get another memory card for your phone. Also, it should have a prominent amount of free storage. You might be facing this issue if the SD card has limited free space.

Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.
