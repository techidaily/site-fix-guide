These issues can also occur in any Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Prologo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Y2 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.
- To clear the cache, select **Clear Cache**.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

- Open the **Settings**.
- Navigate to the A**dditional settings** section of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Redmi 5A settings.
- Please scroll down the screen until you reach the **Backup & reset** option, then click to access it.
- Click**Erase all data (factory reset)** to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Redmi 5A.
- Select **All files on the phone**to make a complete format of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro Redmi 5A.
