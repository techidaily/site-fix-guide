<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Note:** Once you teleport or move to a virtual place, you can restore to the actual location by restarting the Nokia C02 device. You will see a prompt that reminds you to restart your device to restore the location of the connected device when you close the Virtual Location. Click **Restart Device** and close the program.

![restart device on closing virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/restart-decive.png)

_\* Dr.Fone Mac version still has the old interface, but it does not affect the use of Dr.Fone function, we will update it as soon as possible._

The Teleport Mode offered in Virtual Location is a great way to change the location of iOS/Android devices. If you wish to show a different location to someone else, the best way is to use this mode on Virtual Location. This can be done by following the steps described below:

Step 1Activate Teleport Mode

Once you have connected your smartphone, continue to select the **Teleport Mode** option from the top-right section. The particular icon is represented by the first icon from the left in that section.

![select teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Step 2Add Location To Teleport

After activating **Teleport Mode,** click the search bar on the top-left to type in the location where you want to shift. After adding the location, hit **Enter** to proceed.

![look for a location to teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Note:** If you can't find your current location when searching spots on the map, you can click the **Current Virtual Location** icon on the right sidebar to show your current virtual location.

Step 3Confirm the Location For Teleporting

You will be directed to the particular, and the map will display it for confirmation. If you are willing to teleport to this specific location, click **Move Here**.

![confirm the location to spoof](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

Step 4Location Successfully Changed On Computer

The location of the smartphone will be instantly changed to the selected location and will be displayed on the map.

![move location successfully](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

Step 5Location Changed On the Smartphone

Open your smartphone and access its maps application. Look into the current location of the Nokia C02 device and verify it to be the same as the changed location on the computer.

![confirm location on the smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

### Part 2: Instantaneous Movement Between Multiple Points (Jump Teleport Mode)

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also allows the movement of the smartphone device between multiple places with the Jump Teleport Mode. If you want to make your **location spoofing** look realistic, the steps below will be beneficial:

Step 1Activate Jump Teleport Mode

You will have to first access the **Jump Teleport Mode** option from the second icon from the left in the top-right section. This can be done after teleporting the location of the smartphone device.

![turn on jump teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/jump-teleport-mode.png)

Step 2Set Spots to Jump Teleport

Continue to select the spots you want to pass one by one on the map by simply tapping on them with your mouse. After selecting multiple spots, click the **Start Moving** button at the bottom of the left panel to start the movement.

![define points for jump teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/choose-jump-teleport-destination.png)

Step 3Change Location Between Set Spots

As prescribed, you can propagate amongst the set spots with the Jump Teleport Mode. Use the **Next Point** and **Last Point** buttons to shift your location.

![start changing location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/start-use-jump-teleport-mode.png)

## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Nokia C02?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Nokia C02 devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your Nokia C02** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi. So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

### 3.1. How to stop GPS tracking on Nokia C02s?

To hide the location on your Nokia C02 and iPad, below listed are the steps.

**Step 1**. Open the Control Center on your iDevice, iPhone 13 for example. (For iPhone X and above models, swipe down from the top-right, while on other devices, swipe from the bottom of the screen)

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-1.jpg)

**Step 2**. Enable the Airplane Mode or turn off the Wi-Fi and Cellular icon.

**Step 3**. Next, you need to disable the GPS radio. On some of the Nokia C02 devices, there is a separate setting for this. Go to Settings > Privacy> Location Services. The list of the apps using the location services will appear. Move the toggle at the Location Services to turn it off.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-2.jpg)

### 3.2. How to stop GPS tracking on Android Devices?

The process to turn off GPS location on Android devices may vary from device to device and brand to brand. Still, the commonly used steps for turning off the location are listed below.

**Step 1**. On your Nokia C02, swipe down on your screen to open the options list.

![switch off gps on android devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-android-1.jpg)

**Step 2**. Search for the Airplane icon and click on it to turn on the Airplane Mode.

**Step 3**. Next, open the App Drawer and then choose Settings > Location. Turn off the Location.

![drfone virtual location switch off gps on android devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-android-2.jpg)

## Part 4: Spoof Location to prevent GPS Tracing without Turning on Airplane Mode

If you are looking for a method that can prevent GPS tracking without turning on Airplane Mode, spoofing your location is a workable solution. To get this task done, you would need a specialized app or a tool, and here we recommend [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) as the best option.

Using this excellent tool, you can set any fake location across the globe for your Android or iOS device, which will prevent you from being hacked. The tool works on almost all models and brands of devices and is quick and hassle-free.

**Key features of Dr.Fone Virtual Location**

**Steps to spoof and set fake location on Android or iPhone using Dr. Fone-Virtual Location**

**Step 1**. Download, install and launch the Dr. Fone software on your Windows or Mac system.

![home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2**. On the leading software, tap on the **Virtual Location** option and then connect your Nokia C02 or Android device to your system using a USB cable.

![download virtual location and get started](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3**. Click on the **Get Start** button.

**Step 4**. The software will open a new window, and your connected device's actual location will be shown. If the location is not coming correctly, tap on the **Center On** icon present in the lower-right of the interface.

![virtual location map interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

**Step 5**. Next, in the upper-right corner, click on the teleport mode icon. Next, enter the desired location at the upper left-hand side that you wish to teleport to. Finally, click on the **Go** button after entering the site.

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 6**. A pop-up box will appear to click on the **Move Here** button to set the selected location for the connected device. The place will appear on the app interface and the phone.

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the Nokia C02 device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the Nokia C02 device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.

## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Nokia C02

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.
