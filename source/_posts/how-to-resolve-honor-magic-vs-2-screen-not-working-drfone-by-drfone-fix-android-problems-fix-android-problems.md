It's a frustrating scenario, but let's break down the potential reasons why your phone might be displaying this offline status:

1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Honor Magic Vs 2 showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Honor Magic Vs 2.

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Honor Magic Vs 2 can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.
