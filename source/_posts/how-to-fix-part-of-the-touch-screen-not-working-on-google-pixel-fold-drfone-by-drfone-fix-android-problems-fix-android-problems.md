****Step 1:**** To force a restart, press and hold the Google Pixel Fold device’s “Power” button for an extended period.

****Step 2:**** Maintain pressure on the “Power” button. Take your finger off it once you see the manufacturer’s logo.

### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

Always remember to use this tool before you enter in the safe mode as you never know what will happen next and you might end up with factory resetting. This, as the result, will erase all your valuable data. So always perform backup data before you proceed.

To enter the safe mode, follow the instructions below.

Step  1 – First of all, long press the power button and let the Power options appear.

If you are using Android version 4.2 or earlier, turn off the Google Pixel Fold device and turn it on the back by tapping the power button. When the logo appears, tap and hold the volume down button. This will allow the Google Pixel Fold device to boot in safe mode.

Follow these steps carefully and now you can see a “Safe Mode” written at the corner of your device. This will confirm that you have successfully entered in Safe mode on Android.

## Part 3: Safe mode on Android FAQs

In this section, we’ll discuss some frequently asked questions about the safe mode. Some users have many questions regarding the safe mode. Here we’ll try to cover some of them.

**1\. Why is My Google Pixel Fold on safe mode?**

This is a very common question around the world. For many Android device users, it’s quite common to see your phone in safe mode suddenly. Android is a secure platform and if your device sees any threat from your recently installed apps or any programs that want to harm your device; it would go into safe mode automatically. Sometimes, you might accidentally perform the steps discussed in part 2 and boot your device in safe mode.

**2\. Safe mode won't turn off on My Google Pixel Fold**

For the solution to remove safe mode from your device you must follow the step-by-step methods as mentioned in part 1. This will surely take your device out of the safe mode.

The safe mode is a very useful program for any Android device. But it limits the programs of Android and you must remove safe mode after uninstalling the harmful app. This article showed you how to turn off safe mode easily.
