1. **Enabling Airplane mode**

**Why is My Oppo Reno 11 5G showing offline**? Well, one common culprit behind the "offline" message is the accidental activation of Airplane Mode on your Oppo Reno 11 5G.

3. **Glitches or bugs**

Sometimes, glitches or bugs in Google apps installed on your Oppo Reno 11 5G can mislead it into thinking it's offline. [<u>Google Play Services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) or other related applications may encounter issues, causing the phone to display an "offline" message.

Now, you have understood the potential causes as the first step toward resolving the issue. Next, we'll guide you through the process of troubleshooting and getting your Oppo Reno 11 5G back online.

But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:

- **Updates and Compatibility Issues**

Updates are often intended to improve software stability and compatibility, but in some cases, they can introduce new bugs or compatibility issues that lead to crashes. It is particularly evident when app developers and WebView developers release updates that don't fully align, causing conflicts.

- **Insufficient Memory**

Oppo Reno 11 5G Android System WebView requires a certain amount of memory to operate properly. If your device is running low on memory, it can cause Oppo Reno 11 5G Android System WebView to crash. It is more likely to happen on older devices with less RAM.

- **Outdated Oppo Reno 11 5G Android System WebView**

The WebView app is responsible for rendering web content within Android apps. Using an outdated version of WebView can introduce known bugs and security vulnerabilities that can cause crashes.

- **Conflicts With Other Apps**
