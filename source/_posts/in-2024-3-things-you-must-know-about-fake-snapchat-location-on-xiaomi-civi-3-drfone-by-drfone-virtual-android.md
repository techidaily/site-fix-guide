<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

**Step 2:** Connect your Xiaomi Civi 3 to the PC using the lightening cord and click on the “Get Started” option.

![click get started option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3:** Now, you will be able to check your current actual location of yours on the map. After this, you need to activate the “Teleport mode”. This will be the third icon located on the right side of the screen.

Now, enter the location that you desire to teleport and click on the “Go” option.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 4:** The program will analyze the place that you have entered, and it will show you the distance for that place in a pop-up window. Hit on “Move Here”.

![hit on move here](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

You will now be able to check the new location whenever you click the “Center On.”

- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 1:** As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Xiaomi Civi 3.

**Step 2:** Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” > “Security” > “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.

![android version about fgl pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” > “Apps” > “menu” > “Show System” > “Google Play Services” > “Uninstall Updates”.

![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, install the older Google Play Services version that you downgraded earlier. Head to “File Explorer” > “Downloads” and click apk file of Google Play Services. Tap “Install”.

![tap install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, go to “Settings” > “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” > “Google Play Store” and disable it.

**Step 6:** Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” > “FGL Pro”.

![set fgl as mock location app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

**Step 7:** Open the app now and set the desired location. Tap on the “Play” button, and you’re good to go.

![tap on play button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg)

### Method 2: Using VPN

The second effective method to Snapchat fake location is through the help of a VPN. There are a lot of options when it comes to VPN. However, you can choose Surshark if you can’t decide whether it is one of the best VPN that comes with build-in fake GPS tech. It is the cheapest and the VPN that provides you with the perfect way to enhance your Snapchat experience.

![use vpn for snapchat location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg)

### Method 3: Using Xcode

The third method of fake GPS for Snapchat includes Xcode. Through Xcode, you could easily change the Snapchat location. Steps to a fake location with Xcode includes:

**Step 1:** In the first step, you must install Xcode from the Macs app store.

![xcode for snapchat location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-13.jpg)

**Step 2:** Launch it and set up a project. Choose “Single View Application” and click “Next”.

![xcode steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-14.jpg)

**Step 3:** Provide a name to the project and hit “Next”.

![provide a name](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-15.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, you must set up GIT on Xcode. You will notice a screen showing “Please tell me where you are” and the commands.

You are required to enter the commands in “Terminal”. Open it and type the following:

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Please note:** “<you@example.com>” and “your name” should be changed with your info.

![enter the commands](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-16.jpg)

**Step 5:** Connect your Xiaomi Civi 3 to Mac and wait as Xcode will begin to process some files.

![click on debug](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-17.jpg)

## Part 3: What to pay attention to while faking Snapchat location?

There is a certain risk that you may face while using a fake GPS Snapchat map, so you must pay attention while faking Snapchat location. Some of the fake location tools could simulate latitude and longitude perfectly but do not simulate altitude, which may sometime ban your account in Snapchat. Hence you must choose the best tool that could spoof any location without any range limitation.

Some of the Snapchat spoof does not work immediately and may also provide you with some difficulty. Hence here you must wait for some time or restart the Xiaomi Civi 3 device and recheck it.

## Conclusion

Many different tools could help you to spoof Snapchat. But you must always prefer to choose the right one that could perfectly meet your needs. And it could provide you with the best experience of using Snapchat without any difficulty.

So, without wasting too much time, let’s find out the steps to disable/enable Viber location-sharing feature. It’s straightforward.

## Method 2: Change Facebook Location on Android phone

Unlike the strict iPhones, Android allows you to install a third-party app to change the GPS location of your device and Facebook, to be precise. This means you don't need to fork out some serious money for a VPN service. So, in this section, you'll learn to fake a Facebook location on Android using the [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US) app. It is a free program for teleporting your phone IP address to new places with a simple screen tap.

## Method 3: Create A Fake Check-In Location on Facebook

Sometimes you might want to prank your Facebook friends with a new location announcement. In other words, you can make them believe that you're in a particular location when in reality, you're not. In that case, the Facebook Check-In feature will come in handy. It's a simple but highly effective feature that adds your fake location to a Facebook post. Just think of it as a status update.

So, below is **how to fake location on Facebook** with the Check-In feature:

Step 1. Open Facebook on your favorite browser and tap the "**What's on your mind**" field.

Step 2. Next, tap the GPS icon. You'll see all the locations near you. Or, key in a fake address and select it on the suggestions.

![fake address and tap gps icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-03.jpg)

Step 3. Now write whatever is on your mind and add the location to your latest post. It's that easy!

## Method 4: Fake Location for Facebook's Nearby Friends via a Tool

While signing up on Facebook, you'll be requested to allow the platform access to your actual GPS location. This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you're willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you'll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.

It's an all-in-one software that provides multiple solutions for your Xiaomi Civi 3 or Android phone.
