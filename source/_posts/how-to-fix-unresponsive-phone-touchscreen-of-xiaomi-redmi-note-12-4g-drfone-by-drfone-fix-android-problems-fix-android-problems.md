The first thing to protect your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G smartphone from getting stuck on the boot is to keep it safe from unauthorized and malicious data.

Modifying a single file can make your device useless or put you in situations like a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G smartphone stuck on the boot.

### 4\. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone To Manage All Data With Ease
