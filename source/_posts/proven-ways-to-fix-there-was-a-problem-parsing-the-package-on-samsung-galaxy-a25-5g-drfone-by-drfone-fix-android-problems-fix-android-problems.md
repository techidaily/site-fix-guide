### Method 4: Performing a Factory Reset

A [Factory Reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html) is like a phone makeover—it wipes everything and starts fresh. But be cautious, as it erases all data!

Generally, the Factory Reset option should be in **Settings > General & Backup and reset** or under **Settings > About phone** for Android devices.

IOS devices should be under **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone**.
