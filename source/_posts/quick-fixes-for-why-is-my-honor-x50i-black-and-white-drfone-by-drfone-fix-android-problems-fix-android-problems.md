![black phone with android logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Should We Know About Honor X50i Android System WebView Crashes?

This year, the term "**Android WebView crash 2023**" has become a familiar and dreaded phrase. This issue has plagued Android users, causing app crashes, [freezing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-frozen/iphone-keeps-freezing.html), and frustration. But what exactly is Android WebView, and what triggers these apps to crash?

Android WebView is an integral component of Android apps, acting as the invisible engine that renders web content within these apps. It allows users to seamlessly browse websites, watch videos, and interact with web pages without switching to a separate browser. However, when WebView crashes, it disrupts this integrated experience, causing apps to malfunction.

Several signs can indicate an impending or ongoing **Android WebView crash**. These include:

- **App Freezing**

One of the earliest signs of an **Honor X50i Android System WebView crash** is the app freezing. The app may become unresponsive, refusing to respond to your taps or gestures.

- **Unexpected App Closures**

Another common sign is unexpected app closing. The app may shut down without warning, abruptly ending your activity. **Honor X50i Android System WebView crashing apps** can be disruptive if you are in the middle of a conversation, shopping online, or filling out an important form.

- **Error Messages**

Error messages can also provide valuable clues about the impending crash. These messages may appear as pop-ups or be displayed within the app itself.

![webview crash google app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/android-webview-crash-2023-02.jpg)

But why does WebView crash Android smartphones? The answer involves several factors:

- **Updates and Compatibility Issues**

- **Insufficient Memory**

Honor X50i Android System WebView requires a certain amount of memory to operate properly. If your device is running low on memory, it can cause Honor X50i Android System WebView to crash. It is more likely to happen on older devices with less RAM.

- **Outdated Honor X50i Android System WebView**

The WebView app is responsible for rendering web content within Android apps. Using an outdated version of WebView can introduce known bugs and security vulnerabilities that can cause crashes.

- **Conflicts With Other Apps**

WebView might crash if it conflicts with other resources or processes running on the Honor X50i device. It can happen if the Honor X50i device runs low on memory or other resource-intensive apps compete for system resources.

In the next section, you'll explore potential solutions to keep your apps running smoothly.

With no proper method left for the Honor X50i device, the only effective technique is to visit the authorized store for Honor X50i smartphones and claim the issue with the Honor X50i device.

## Part 3: How to Avoid Honor X50i Screen Stuck on Boot?

What if you come to know that you can avoid the Honor X50i screen stuck-on boot problem? There are a set of tips and tricks that you can follow to explain how to prevent such an issue in the first place. Follow these tips to learn more about saving your Honor X50i from such miserable conditions:

### 1\. Protect from Malware

The first thing to protect your Honor X50i smartphone from getting stuck on the boot is to keep it safe from unauthorized and malicious data. The best thing to keep a device secure is to follow all security protocols and avoid bypassing them. If you try downloading something not authorized by the Play Store itself, for instance, an APK, it can make your device vulnerable to malware.

### 2\. Keep Your Device Updated

If you feel frustrated by issues like ****Honor X50i being stuck on the Android One screen,**** the best thing to avoid such a problem is to keep your device updated at all costs. Whenever there is an update on your Honor X50i smartphone, make sure to install it on time and properly. Do not leave updates uninstalled for no reason, as they can hinder the Honor X50i device’s speed and performance.

### 3\. Do Not Fool Around with System Files

Changing or modifying system files can be fatal for smartphones. Thus, to keep your Honor X50i safe, you need to keep your hands away from such important files. Modifying a single file can make your device useless or put you in situations like a Honor X50i smartphone stuck on the boot. For that, the best tip is to keep yourself out of engagement.

### 4\. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone To Manage All Data With Ease

As you have observed, the power of Dr.Fone can be a perfect phone manager for you at all times. While providing system repair services, it can also help you manage your device's data and other statuses. Thus, consider keeping Dr.Fone close to your device and its operations. In this way, you will be able to have complete control over all types of data present in the Honor X50i smartphone.
