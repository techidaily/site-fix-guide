### Restart Your Device

****Step 3:**** Press and hold the “Power” button to restart the OnePlus 11R device.

### Turn On Safe Mode

You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

It’s also a great habit to beware of the computers you’re connecting your phone to.

You might notice weird things happening on your phone when infected with a virus. It may suddenly slow down, show pop-ups you didn’t click, or [run out of battery super-fast](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/run-phone-batery-test-on-xiaomi.html). These could be signs that your phone has a virus. Take note of these.

![hacker with virus tools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-02.jpg)

Here are some common ways viruses get into your phone:

- **Accessing sketchy links.**Clicking on strange or suspicious links in messages or emails is the number one virus source.
- **Downloading apps from unauthorized developers.**Getting apps from places other than the official app stores like Google Play or Apple Store can also be a gateway for trojan viruses. This is mainly because apps install files directly to your system when downloaded.
- **Connecting to compromised computers.** Watching out for viruses or malware when plugging your phone into a computer would be best.
- **Transferring malware files to your phone:**Moving files with viruses from a computer or another device to your phone.

Remember, these bugs can cause a lot of trouble, but staying careful while using your phone can help you avoid them!

### Method 2: Using Safe Mode

Safe Mode is like a secret agent—it helps but with a downside. It turns off third-party apps, making your phone useful only for basic calls or texts. Use this method if any solutions in this section do not work. It’s especially handy if you use your phone before sending it to a technician. This way, you’ll learn **how you can get a virus off your phone** before actually letting a technician do it.

Generally, here’s how you can [enter Safe Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) on Android Phones. Do check with your phone manufacturer’s official manual/guides on how to enter them:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button. Wait for the power options to appear.
- **Step 2:** Tap and hold the **Power Off** button.
- **Step 3:** Tap on the prompt when you see the **Reboot to safe mode** option.

![android safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-11.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Power off your iPhone.
- **Step 2:** Hold the power button.
- **Step 3:** Hold the volume down button until you see the Apple logo.
- **Step 4:** Your phone should now be in safe mode.

![ios safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-12.jpg)

### Method 3: Downloading Anti-Virus Software

Anti-virus software works like a shield, protecting your phone from sneaky viruses and malware. Here are three recommended anti-virus apps that you should try out. They’re available on both the Google Play Store and App Store. So, regardless of what device you’re using, you’re sure to be safe with these:

- Avast Anti-virus – Mobile Security
- Norton 360: Online Security
- Bitdefender Mobile Security & Anti-virus

### Method 4: Performing a Factory Reset

A [Factory Reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html) is like a phone makeover—it wipes everything and starts fresh. But be cautious, as it erases all data!

Generally, the Factory Reset option should be in **Settings > General & Backup and reset** or under **Settings > About phone** for Android devices.

![miui factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-13.jpg)

IOS devices should be under **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone**.

![ios transfer or reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-14.jpg)

Remember, each method has its strengths and weaknesses. Dr.Fone is quick and effective, Safe Mode is limited but useful, anti-virus apps can protect, and a Factory Reset gives a clean slate. Try these methods to zap those viruses away!

## Part 3: Handy Prevention Tips To Avoid Future Infections

- **Regular software updates:**Keep your phone updated with the latest software. Updates often include security patches that protect your phone from new threats.
- **Cautious downloads:**Be careful when downloading apps or files. Stick to trusted sources like Google Play Store or Apple Store. Avoid clicking on suspicious links from unknown sources.
- **Secure networks:**Use secure Wi-Fi networks and limit public Wi-Fi use for sensitive activities. Public networks can expose your device to potential risks.
