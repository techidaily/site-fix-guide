## Calls on Itel P55 Go Straight to Voicemail? 12 Fixes

## Part 1: Not Ringing? Here’s Why Calls on Your Phone Go Straight to Voicemail

If an incoming call to your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** without ringing, there could be a few reasons. Here’s what to look for and what you should do to fix it:

1. Turn Off Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode

DND mode is a feature that silences all incoming calls, notifications, and alerts. If DND mode is enabled, your **cell phone goes straight to voicemail** when someone calls. To turn off DND mode, swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification settings panel, then tap the **Do not disturb** icon.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app on your device, then tap the **menu** icon and select **Settings**.

![phone dial app settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/phone-go-straight-to-voicemail-04.jpg)

3. Disable Call Barring

If a phone **call went straight to voicemail**, another possible explanation is the call barring. It is a feature that restricts calls from being made or received on your phone. If activated, it can cause incoming calls to a phone to go straight to voicemail. To turn off call barring on Itel P55 devices:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Phone Dialer** app, then tap the **menu** icon in the top right corner.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Settings** > **Supplementary services** > **Call barring**, then tap **OK**.

### 2. Force-Close the App

You can force-close Spotify and open it again to make it work properly. That is an easy fix if your Spotify has developed a bug. If that is the case, follow the next steps:

- **Step 1:** Try opening Spotify.
- **Step 2:** If it’s not working, open **App Switcher** or **Recent Apps**. Different Android devices open it differently. Thus, you can swipe up from your Home screen, or if you have three buttons at the bottom, press **Recent Apps**.

![recent apps on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-3.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Find Spotify in **Recent Apps**and click **X** or swipe up over it to force-close it.
- **Step 4:** Try opening Spotify again.

### 3. Re-Login to Your Spotify

The Spotify app may be working fine. Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open Spotify.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Settings**in the upper right corner.

![settings in spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap **Log Out**.

![log out of spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg)

### 4. Restart Your Device

Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Itel P55 device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the **Power button**(you must press and hold both the **Power** and **Volume Up** buttons on a newer Android device).
- **Step 2:** Tap **Restart**. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.

### 5. Set Up Your Time and Date

Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Go to **System**or **General Management** (depending on your Android model).
- **Step 3:** Go to **Date and Time**.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Set Date**and set the correct date.

![set time on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg)

### 6. Update Your System Software

Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated. Try updating it to the latest version to try and fix the crashing problem. The steps for the Android system update are as follows:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on your android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **System** or **About Phone**.

![about phone to find system update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-12.jpg)

![install system update on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-13.jpg)

### 7. Update Your App

If your system is updated, then Spotify might need an update. The app might malfunction if you’re using an older version. Thus, updating the app might solve the Spotify crashing problem. You can update Spotify by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the **Play Store**.

![play store on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-14.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Search and open Spotify in the Play Store.
- **Step 3:** Tap Update

![update spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-15.jpg)

### 8. Free up Storage

Spotify can start crashing if your Android’s storage space is at capacity. That can also cause other apps to crash, not only Spotify. Therefore, check the storage space and free up as much as possible. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Here, you can see how much of your storage space is available and what’s taking up the most space.

![available storage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-17.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Then, you can go ahead and clear as much space as you can.

### 9. Reinstall Spotify

There’s another solution if the Spotify app keeps crashing. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling it again on your Android. That will reset the app and might solve your problem. Follow the next steps to reinstall Spotify:

- **Step 1:** Find the Spotify app on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Hold the app icon.
- **Step 3:** Then, press **Uninstall**.

![uninstall spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-18.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Press **OK**.
- **Step 5:** Then, open the PlayStore and find Spotify.
- **Step 6:** Tap **Install**to reinstall the app again.

![reinstall spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-19.jpg)

- **Step 7:** Once it installs, log in to test if it’s working.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several websites that check real-time app servers and if they’re down.

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **Apps**.
- **Step 3:** Find **Spotify** and tap it.

![spotify in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-23.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Tap **Storage**or **Storage usage**.

![spotify storage usage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-24.jpg)
