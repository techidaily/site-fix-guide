- ****Step 1:**** You will need to launch Settings on your Tecno Spark Go (2023) and tap “Apps.” Here find and select the targeted app to open App Info.

### Fix 8: Check and Clear the Phone Storage

Insufficient storage space on your device can also lead to app crashes. Check the available storage space on your Tecno Spark Go (2023) and ensure it has enough free space. If the storage is full, consider deleting unnecessary files or apps to create more space. Explained below is the process to check and free up storage on Android devices:

- ****Step 1:**** Open Settings on your Tecno Spark Go (2023) and scroll down to find and select “Battery and Device Care.” Here, tap “Storage” to view the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device storage.

### Fix 9: Reboot Into Safe Mode

It can be hard to find the ****app crashing**** root cause if it happens due to conflicts between different apps. In such scenarios, the best way to find the problematic apps is to use Safe Mode on your device.

- ****Step 1:**** Press and hold the “Volume Down” and “Power” buttons together for 3 seconds to access the power menu. Here, long-press the “Power Off” option.

![hold the power off option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/apps-keeps-crashing-android-13.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** Press the “Power Off” button until “Restart in Safe Mode” appears on the screen. Now reboot the Tecno Spark Go (2023) device into Safe Mode. To exit Safe Mode, you will need to restart the phone.
