This should solve the problem. If not, move on to the other techniques.

#### **2.4 Check APK File**

An incomplete and irregular App installation may cause the .apk file to get corrupted. Make sure you download the file completely. If need be, delete the existing App or its .apk file and reinstall it from Google Play Store for it to be compatible with your device’s software and to use the App smoothly.

#### **2.5 Check App Manifest File**

Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently. Modifications in the App file can be made by changing its name, App settings, or more advanced customizations. Make sure you roll back all changes and restore the App file to its original state to prevent it from getting corrupted.

#### **2.6 Disable Antivirus and other cleaner Apps**

Antivirus software and other cleaning Apps are very helpful in blocking unwanted and harmful Apps from damaging your device. However, sometimes such Apps also prevent you from using other safe Apps.

We do not suggest that you delete the Antivirus App permanently. Temporary uninstallation will be useful here. To do so:

• Visit “Settings” and then select “Apps”.

• Select the antivirus App to click on “Uninstall” and then tap “OK”.

![click on “Uninstall”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985109617315.jpg)

Now download and install the desired App again. Once this is done, do not forget to install the Antivirus App again.

#### **2.7 Clear Cache cookies of Play Store**

Clearing Play Store Cache cleans the Android Market platform by deleting all clogged up unwanted data. Follow the steps given below to delete Play Store cache:

• Tap on Google Play Store App.

• Now visit Play Store’s “Settings”.

![visit Play Store’s “Settings”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985109949391.jpg)

• Select “General Settings” to “Clear local search history”.

![“Clear local search history”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985110201340.jpg)

#### **2.8 Factory Reset Android**

Factory Resetting your device to fix the Parse Error should be the last thing you try. Make sure you take a back-up of all your data on your Google Account or a Pen Drive because this technique erases all media, contents, data, and other files, including your device settings.

Follow the steps given below to factory reset your device:

• Visit “Settings”.

• Now select “Backup and Reset”.

![select “Backup and Reset”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985110589339.jpg)

• In this step, select “Factory data reset” and then “Reset Device” to confirm Factory Reset.

The whole process of factory resetting your Honor Play 40C might sound tedious, risky, and cumbersome but it helps to fix the Android SystemUI has stopped error 9 out of 10 times. So, think carefully before using this remedy.

The good part is that the above-stated fixes not only solve the problem but also prevent it from occurring in the future. So, keep them in mind the next time you or anyone you know faces such an issue.

4. Keep another backup on your PC which you can access should anything go wrong with the Custom ROM installation

While installing Custom ROM can actually be a great way to customize your device, it is also the leading reason for bricked devices. Therefore ensure that you understand what you are doing when you decide to customize your device. Learn as much as you can about the process before attempting everything.
