## Part 3: 10 Common Fixes When Google Play Services Won’t Update

### Method 1. Restart your Android and try to update again

In most cases, restarting the Vivo Y77t device can simply do the trick. When you restart the Vivo Y77t device, most of the issues get eliminated making the Vivo Y77t device perform better than before. Also, it is all about RAM. While you restart your device, the RAM gets cleared. As a result, the apps work properly. So, in the first place, we would like you to restart your Vivo Y77t when you cannot update Google Play Services. Once restarted, try to update again and see if the results are positive.

### Method 2. Uninstall Google Play Services Updates and Reattempt the Update

Uninstalling previous Google Play Services updates resolves conflicts and errors, often addressing the issue of updates. This process clears potential obstacles, enabling a successful update of Google Play Services. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your device's "Settings."
2. Scroll down and select "Apps" or "App Manager."
3. Locate and tap on "Google Play Services."
4. Depending on your device and Android version, you might need to tap on "App info" or "Storage."
5. Look for the option to "Uninstall updates." This will revert Google Play Services to its original version.
6. Confirm the action when prompted.
7. Once the updates are uninstalled, go back to the Google Play Store.
8. Search for "Google Play Services" using the search bar at the top.
9. If an update is available, you'll see the option to "Update." Tap on it to start the update process.
10. After the update is complete, restart your device to ensure the changes take effect.

### Method 3. Update Google Play Store

Ensure that you have the latest version of the Google Play Store app installed on your device. Open the Play Store, go to Settings, and check for updates. Updating the Play Store can often resolve compatibility issues with Google Play Services updates.

### Method 4. Google account and re-add it

Go to your device's Settings, select Accounts or Users, and remove your Google account. Restart your device and add the account again. This process can refresh the connection and resolve update issues.

### Method 5. Uninstall unnecessary apps

As we mentioned above, due to a lot of apps being installed at the same time, the issue can crop up. And hence, if the above solution didn’t help, you can try to uninstall the apps that you don’t need currently. We hope this works. But if not, you can go to the next fix.

### Method 6. Clear Google Play Services cache

If still you cannot update Google Play Services, clearing cache can solve your problem. We also stated this in the beginning as the reason. If you don’t know, cache holds the app’s data temporarily so that it can remember the information when you next open the app. Many times, old cache files get corrupted. And clearing cache can also help in saving storage space on your device. For these reasons, you need to clear cache of Google Play Services to get rid of the problem.

Here is how to clear Google Play Services cache:

![set correct date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/clear-cache.jpg)

- Launch “Settings” on your phone and go to “Apps & Notifications” or “Application” or “Application Manager”.
- Now, from all the apps’ list, choose “Google Play Services”.
- On opening it, tap “Storage” followed by “Clear Cache”.

### Method 7. Boot into download mode to clear cache of whole phone

If unfortunately, things are still the same, we would like to recommend you wipe the cache of the whole device to fix the issue. This is an advanced method to solve issues and is helpful when the Vivo Y77t device is facing any flaws or malfunctions. For this, you need to go to the download mode or recovery mode of your device. Every device has its own steps for this. Like in some, you need to simultaneously press the “Power” and “Volume Down” keys. While in some, the “Power” and both “Volume” keys work.

This is how it works when Google Play Services can't be installed on your device:

![google play services not installing - wipe cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/wipe-data.jpg)

- Turn off the Vivo Y77t device to begin with and then follow the steps for recovery mode.
- On the recovery screen, use the “Volume” buttons for scrolling up and down and go to “Wipe cache partition”.
- To confirm, press the “Power” button. Now, the Vivo Y77t device will begin to wipe the cache.
- Hit reboot when asked and the Vivo Y77t device will now be rebooted finishing the issue.

### Method 8. Check your Android storage

Generally speaking, Google Play Services can update automatically in the background. But if there is not enough storage on your Android, the automatic update may fail, so check your android space.

### Method 9. battery optimization

Some devices aggressively optimize battery usage, which can interfere with the background processes required for updating Google Play Services. Disable battery optimization for Google Play Services in the Vivo Y77t device's Settings to ensure uninterrupted updates.

### Method 10. Check date and time settings

Sometimes, incorrect date and time settings on your device can cause conflicts with Google Play Services updates. Ensure that your device's date and time are set correctly and set to automatic. Follow the steps below to set the date and time on your android correctly.

![set correct date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/date-and-time.jpg)

- Open "Settings" and go to "General Management".
- Click "Date & time" and then enable "Automatic date & time". Or you can disable and re-enable it.

### Method 11. Factory Reset your Android

As a final measure, if everything went in vain, you can perform a factory reset on your device. This method will wipe away all your data while performing and make the Vivo Y77t device go to factory state. Please ensure to keep backing up your important data if you are going to take the help of this method.

The steps are:

![google play services not installing - reset factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/factory-reset.jpg)

- Open “Settings” and go to “Backup & Reset”.
- Choose “Factory Reset” followed by “Reset Phone”.
