## Reliable User Guide to Fix Oppo A2 Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Oppo A2 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Oppo A2 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Oppo A2 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Oppo A2 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Oppo A2 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Oppo A2 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Oppo A2 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Oppo A2 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Oppo A2s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Oppo A2 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Oppo A2 device. So if your Oppo A2 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Oppo A2 device’s animation type and speed on your Oppo A2 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Oppo A2 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Oppo A2 is running slow and freezing, the Oppo A2 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Oppo A2 device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Oppo A2 is running slow and freezing.

### Your Internet Connection is Unstable

Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Oppo A2 is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.

## What to Do When My Oppo A2 Lags?

It’s not as bad as the black screen of death when the Android phone runs slow. However, it can still cause some delays and inconvenience for users.

That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open Spotify.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Settings**in the upper right corner.

### 4. Restart Your Device

Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Oppo A2 device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the **Power button**(you must press and hold both the **Power** and **Volume Up** buttons on a newer Android device).
- **Step 2:** Tap **Restart**. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.

### 5. Set Up Your Time and Date

Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Go to **System**or **General Management** (depending on your Android model).
- **Step 3:** Go to **Date and Time**.

### 7. Update Your App

If your system is updated, then Spotify might need an update. The app might malfunction if you’re using an older version. Thus, updating the app might solve the Spotify crashing problem. You can update Spotify by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the **Play Store**.

![play store on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-14.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![update spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-15.jpg)

### 8. Free up Storage

Spotify can start crashing if your Android’s storage space is at capacity. That can also cause other apps to crash, not only Spotify. Therefore, check the storage space and free up as much as possible. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Here, you can see how much of your storage space is available and what’s taking up the most space.

![available storage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-17.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Then, you can go ahead and clear as much space as you can.

### 9. Reinstall Spotify

There’s another solution if the Spotify app keeps crashing. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling it again on your Android. That will reset the app and might solve your problem. Follow the next steps to reinstall Spotify:

- **Step 1:** Find the Spotify app on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Hold the app icon.
- **Step 3:** Then, press **Uninstall**.

![uninstall spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-18.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Press **OK**.
- **Step 5:** Then, open the PlayStore and find Spotify.
- **Step 6:** Tap **Install**to reinstall the app again.

![reinstall spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-19.jpg)

- **Step 7:** Once it installs, log in to test if it’s working.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several websites that check real-time app servers and if they’re down.

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **Apps**.
- **Step 3:** Find **Spotify** and tap it.

![spotify in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-23.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Tap **Storage**or **Storage usage**.

![spotify storage usage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-24.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Tap **Clear Cache**.
