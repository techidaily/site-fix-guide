This article will share the possible reasons why your ****phone is stuck on the boot screen****. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and three valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, there is an application that is recommended and is sure to solve your issue in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!

It is not uncommon for **phones** to be ****stuck on the startup screen****, but finding out why this happens is tricky. This section identified some of the top reasons your cellphone could have gotten stuck on the startup screen.

### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your ****phone getting stuck on the logo.****

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

![iphone water indicator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg)

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

## Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen

After understanding the common problems on why your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen**** page, here are three easy solutions to try solving yourself at home.

### Hard reboot your phone

To quickly fix any of your phone issues, especially when stuck on the startup screen, perform a hard reboot. The term hard reboot means turning your device off and on again. You might think this is a simple option, but this is a tried and tested method that might work on a minor glitch that results in your smartphone getting ****stuck on the startup screen**** page.

Here is an example of performing a hard reboot for an Android phone such as Oppo A79 5G. Preess and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to perform the hard reboot.

![hard reboot of samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-03.jpg)

### Put your phone in recovery mode

If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.

Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.

![android screen problems intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems

Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.

- The **touchscreen problem**freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.
- Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.
- Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).
- The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.
- It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.
- The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.
- Outdated devices are prone to the black/white/blue screen of death.

## Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Oppo A79 5G Touch Problems

If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your **touch screen malfunctioning,** here are some solutions to fix it.

### Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case

Some phone cases and screen protectors cause **touch problems** on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.

![android remove screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg)

### Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone

A **touchscreen malfunctioning** can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.

![android dirty screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

**Touch problems** also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.

### Method 4: Restart Your Android

Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a **touchscreen problem** on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.

![android restart method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg)

To restart your Android, press and hold the **Power** button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Down** button at the same time.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg)

Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.

### Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode

If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.

**Step 3**: Wait for the process to complete and for your Oppo A79 5G to restart automatically.

### Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen

If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the **touchscreen problem,** it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Oppo A79 5G checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.

### Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center

## Reasons for Oppo A79 5G Stuck on Boot Screen and Ways To Fix Them

One of the main reasons why people own a phone is for convenience. It will be ironic if that device, supposed to grant convenience, provides problems instead. Some people face this when their ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page and unable to do anything. As expected, this is common in Android phones and is why people are unhappy with Android phones.

This article will share the possible reasons why your ****Android phone is stuck on the boot screen****. This article will share three possible reasons for this problem and five valuable tips to help fix this issue. If all else fails, we have an application to share and recommend that is guaranteed to solve your problem in no time. Keep on reading to find out more!

## Part 1. Why Is Your Oppo A79 5G Stuck on the Boot Screen?

There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your ****Android boot screen**** happens and some tips to overcome it.

### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Oppo A79 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Oppo A79 5G functioning properly.

### 2. Pull Out Battery

Another way to restart your Oppo A79 5G when it is frozen is to try taking the battery out.

### 4. Wipe Cache Data

Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Oppo A79 5G device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Oppo A79 5G to become slower and eventually get stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

Wiping out the cache data from your Oppo A79 5G could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.

### 5. Factory Reset

If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.

Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Oppo A79 5G:

**Step 1:** Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time

**Step 2:** Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data/factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.
