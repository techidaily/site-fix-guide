### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Realme 12 Pro 5G has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Realme 12 Pro 5G functioning properly.

### 2.2 Ensure the SIM card is not dirty or wet

At times, the issue can be as simple as cleaning your SIM card and SIM slot properly. Ensuring that SIM is not wet either and then putting it back into its place. If this works, then the SIM not working in Android was due to the dirt or moisture that was preventing proper contact between SIM card pins and smartphone circuit.

### 2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly

If your SIM card was working properly until yet, there is a good possibility that the SIM card may have moved a bit from its actual location. Eventually, there is poor contact between the SIM card pins and the circuit. Try inserting your SIM card properly with the following steps.

- Power off your Realme 12 Pro 5G and with the help of Q pin, eject the SIM card holder from the SIM slot of your device.
- Now, grab a soft rubber pencil eraser and gently rub it in on the gold pins of SIM card to clean them properly. Then, with the help of a soft cloth wipe away the rubber residue from the SIM card.
- Next, push the SIM back into the SIM card holder properly and push it back into the SIM slot now.
- Turn your device back on and look if your SIM not provisioned on the Android issue is resolved or not.

### 2.4 Activate the SIM card

Usually, when you buy a new SIM card, it gets automatically activated within 24 hours of being plugged into a new device. But if that’s not happening in your case and you’re wondering how to activate SIM card, make use of the three options below to enable activation:

- Call your carrier service provider
- Send an SMS
- Log on to your carrier’s website and look for the activation page over it.

Note: The aforementioned options are straightforward and are quick ways to enable activation. It depends on your carrier network whether they support them.

### 2.5 Contact your carrier

Even if your SIM isn’t activated, grab another working device to make a phone call to your carrier or network. Ensure, to explain the entire situation and the error message to them. Be patient while they investigate the issue. It may eat up a heck load of time or may get resolved in a few minutes that completely depend upon the complexity of the issue.

![fix SIM not working in android - contact carrier](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/contact-carrier.jpg)

### 2.6 Try the other SIM card slot

A yet another reason why SIM not working in Android can be because of the SIM card slot might have gone corrupted. Thanks to the dual SIM technology, you do not have to rush immediately to get it to check or repair. You can simply rule out this possibility by ejecting the SIM card from its original SIM slot and then replacing it into the other SIM card slot. If this solution did work out for you then it is obvious that the problem was with the SIM card slot that got corrupted. And hence, it was triggering SIM not responding issue.

![fix SIM not responding - try another slot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/05/insert-sim-properly.jpg)

### 2.7 Try the SIM card in other phones

Or just in case, you’ve still no joy and the SIM not provisioned on Android message is bothering you. Try making use of another Android device. Eject the SIM card from the Realme 12 Pro 5G device which is creating problems and try plugging it into other Realme 12 Pro 5G] and other smartphones. Perhaps, this will let you know whether the issue is with your device only or with the SIM card itself.
