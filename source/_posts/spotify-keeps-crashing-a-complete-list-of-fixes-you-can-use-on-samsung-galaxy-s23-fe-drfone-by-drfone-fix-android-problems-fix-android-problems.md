### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue.

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Samsung Galaxy S23 FE smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Samsung Galaxy S23 FE touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Samsung Galaxy S23 FE phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Samsung Galaxy S23 FE smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Samsung Galaxy S23 FE 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device itself**

Screens on Samsung Galaxy S23 FE devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Samsung Galaxy S23 FE 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device unusable.
