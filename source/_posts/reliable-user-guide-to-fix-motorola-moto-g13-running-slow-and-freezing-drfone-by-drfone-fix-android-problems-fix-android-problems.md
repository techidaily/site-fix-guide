## Reliable User Guide to Fix Motorola Moto G13 Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Motorola Moto G13 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Motorola Moto G13 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Motorola Moto G13 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Motorola Moto G13 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Motorola Moto G13 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Motorola Moto G13 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button. Wait for the power options to appear.
- **Step 2:** Tap and hold the **Power Off** button.
- **Step 3:** Tap on the prompt when you see the **Reboot to safe mode** option.

### Method 3: Downloading Anti-Virus Software

Anti-virus software works like a shield, protecting your phone from sneaky viruses and malware. Here are three recommended anti-virus apps that you should try out. They’re available on both the Google Play Store and App Store. So, regardless of what device you’re using, you’re sure to be safe with these:

- Avast Anti-virus – Mobile Security
- Norton 360: Online Security
- Bitdefender Mobile Security & Anti-virus

### Method 4: Performing a Factory Reset

Generally, the Factory Reset option should be in **Settings > General & Backup and reset** or under **Settings > About phone** for Android devices.
