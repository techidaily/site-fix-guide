## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Realme C53 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Realme C53 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Realme C53 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Realme C53 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Realme C53 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Realme C53 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Realme C53 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Realme C53 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Realme C53s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Realme C53 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Realme C53 device. So if your Realme C53 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Realme C53 device’s animation type and speed on your Realme C53 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Realme C53 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Realme C53 is running slow and freezing, the Realme C53 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Realme C53 device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Realme C53 is running slow and freezing.

### Your Internet Connection is Unstable

Of course, a slow internet connection can make the Android phone runs slow too. Most apps today rely heavily on the internet to execute some tasks like communicating and streaming. So don’t panic when your Realme C53 is running slow and freezing. It’s possible that your internet connection is messing up with you.

In everyday settings, our mobile devices have become our greatest friends, therefore breaking your phone is the last thing you want to do. There are different reasons why devices brick, and we must be familiar with them in order to comprehend the various techniques to repair bricked devices.

Here are some common reasons why your Realme C53 is bricked:

- **Flashing Stock/Custom ROM:**It is possible that you installed an incompatible ROM in the Android phone, that the phone shuts off during the process, or that you have performed other errors that cause your phone to restart indefinitely or to become stuck at the starting screen.
- **Rooting an Android device:**You are unable to effectively root the Realme C53 device.
- **Android firmware is being updated:**If the phone is interrupted when updating the Android firmware, it will be bricked.
- **Installing harmful applications:**You installed harmful programs on your Realme C53, or the phone was infected with a virus.

However, there is no specific software to unbrick your Realme C53; you may need to learn the complexities of this issue or hire a professional to do it for you.

- **Step 1:** Turn off your smartphone and enter recovery mode by pressing the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Different devices have various approaches for entering recovery mode, so you may perform better.
- **Step 2:** After entering recovery mode, you should see the screen below. Remember to pick Advanced and then “Wipe Dalvik Cache” if your device is under Clockwork Mod recovery. Return to the main screen and select “Wipe Cache Partition” once more.

## Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone

How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Realme C53 device and halt it before the Realme C53 device disables itself.

- **Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:** Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer's warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.

- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.
- **Backup your phone data regularly:** Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.
