## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Oppo A78 device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Oppo A78 device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Oppo A78 freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.
- **Unexpected Reboots and Crashes.**Frequent and unprovoked reboots, app crashes, and system instability might point toward software inconsistencies. Similar to consistent black screens, this could eventually lead to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Oppo A78 Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Oppo A78 devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.

#### Unauthorized User Modifications

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Oppo A78 device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Oppo A78 device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Oppo A78 device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.

## Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android

In this segment, we will discuss solutions to the problem if all your Apps won't open. They are simple and easy to follow and solve the error in no time.

1\. Android updates

Firstly, it is very important to keep your Android software updated at all times as an old Android version might not support new Apps or updated Apps.

To update your software:

• Visit “Settings” and keep going downwards.

• Now select “About Phone”.

• From the options available on the screen, tap on “System Updates"

![tap on “System Updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184697337.jpg)

• In this step, if you are prompted for an update, follow the instruction given and do so.

Updating your Android software solves most of your problems. This method might sound weird but works wonders when it comes to App related issues.

2\. Restart the phone

Restarting your Oppo A78 to fix an error might sound old school but it gives good results when your Apps won't open. Restarting your phone is fairly simple. All you need to do is:

• Long press the power button.

• Now click on “Restart”.

![click on “Restart”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184913200.jpg)

Your phone will automatically restart and once it does, you can try to launch the App. You may also restart your Oppo A78 by pressing the power button for about 15-20 seconds.

3\. Reset Factory Settings

This method is a little tedious and must be last on your list. Also, make sure you take a backup of all your data and contents stored on your Oppo A78 and this solution will completely wipe off your phone making as good as a new smartphone.

To Factory Reset your Oppo A78, carefully follow the guidelines given below:

• Visit “Settings” to find the “Backup and reset” option as shown in the screenshot below.

![Backup and reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984185141857.jpg)

• Now click on “Factory Data Reset”>“Reset Device”>“Erase Everything”

Your phone will now reboot and will be required to set up from scratch.

“Why Won’t my App open” is a question asked by many Android phone users who fear that the problem occurs due to a virus attack or a system failure. However, this is not the case. The reason for the error to the surface is quite minor and can be fixed by you, sitting at home, without resorting to any kind of technical or external assistance. The solutions listed above are easy to understand and not very time-consuming.

So go ahead and try them out now!
