### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Motorola Moto G14 has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Motorola Moto G14 functioning properly.

## Common Causes of Motorola Moto G14 Screen Unresponsiveness

While Motorola Moto G14 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Motorola Moto G14 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Motorola Moto G14, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Motorola Moto G14 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Motorola Moto G14 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Motorola Moto G14 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Motorola Moto G14 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Motorola Moto G14 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Motorola Moto G14 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Motorola Moto G14 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Motorola Moto G14 Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.
