## Part 2: How to put the phone in safe mode?

If some apps or programs create a problem on your device, the solution is safe mode. Safe mode allows you to uninstall the app or the program out of your device safely. So, safe mode on Android is quite useful sometimes. Let’s have a look at how to turn on safe mode in Android.

Before this, remember to take a backup of your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition. We recommend you to use the Dr.Fone - Phone Backup (Android). This tool is the best in its class to provide users with a very easy-to-use user interface yet powerful solution.



### Dr.Fone - Phone Backup (Android)\_

Flexibly Backup and Restore Android Data

- Selectively backup Android data to the computer with one click.
- Preview and restore the backup to any Android devices.
- Supports 8000+ Android devices.
- There is no data lost during backup, export, or restore.

Always remember to use this tool before you enter in the safe mode as you never know what will happen next and you might end up with factory resetting. This, as the result, will erase all your valuable data. So always perform backup data before you proceed.

To enter the safe mode, follow the instructions below.

Step  1 – First of all, long press the power button and let the Power options appear.

If you are using Android version 4.2 or earlier, turn off the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device and turn it on the back by tapping the power button. When the logo appears, tap and hold the volume down button. This will allow the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device to boot in safe mode.

Follow these steps carefully and now you can see a “Safe Mode” written at the corner of your device. This will confirm that you have successfully entered in Safe mode on Android.

## Part 3: Safe mode on Android FAQs

In this section, we’ll discuss some frequently asked questions about the safe mode. Some users have many questions regarding the safe mode. Here we’ll try to cover some of them.

**1\. Why is My Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition on safe mode?**

This is a very common question around the world. For many Android device users, it’s quite common to see your phone in safe mode suddenly. Android is a secure platform and if your device sees any threat from your recently installed apps or any programs that want to harm your device; it would go into safe mode automatically. Sometimes, you might accidentally perform the steps discussed in part 2 and boot your device in safe mode.

**2\. Safe mode won't turn off on My Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition**

For the solution to remove safe mode from your device you must follow the step-by-step methods as mentioned in part 1. This will surely take your device out of the safe mode.

The safe mode is a very useful program for any Android device. But it limits the programs of Android and you must remove safe mode after uninstalling the harmful app. This article showed you how to turn off safe mode easily.
