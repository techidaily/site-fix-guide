Manifested App files are nothing but .apk files which are improvised by you. Such changes may cause the Parse Error to occur more frequently.

While HTC U23 devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an HTC U23 device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the HTC U23, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an HTC U23 device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the HTC U23 F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an HTC U23 device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the HTC U23 Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the HTC U23 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the HTC U23 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While HTC U23 devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

## How to Avoid HTC U23 Screen Unresponsiveness Issue

One of the most effective ways to prevent HTC U23 Screen unresponsiveness is by keeping the HTC U23 device software up-to-date. Regularly checking for system updates and installing them promptly can prevent software issues and potential bugs that may cause unresponsiveness. Additionally, updating device apps can help prevent conflicts that affect the touch screen's functionality.

Another way to avoid HTC U23 Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the HTC U23 device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness. Avoiding impacts or drops can also reduce the risk of physical damage to the touch screen.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the HTC U23 device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the HTC U23 App Store.
