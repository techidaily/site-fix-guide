However, sometimes users may encounter problems such as a **Samsung Galaxy M34 touch screen not working**, which can be frustrating and difficult.

This article aims to provide solutions for Samsung Galaxy M34 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Samsung Galaxy M34 touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Samsung Galaxy M34 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Samsung Galaxy M34 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Samsung Galaxy M34 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Samsung Galaxy M34 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Samsung Galaxy M34 device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Samsung Galaxy M34 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Samsung Galaxy M34 model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Samsung Galaxy M34 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Samsung Galaxy M34 Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Samsung Galaxy M34 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Samsung Galaxy M34 model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Samsung Galaxy M34 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Samsung Galaxy M34's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Samsung Galaxy M34 device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Samsung Galaxy M34 device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Samsung Galaxy M34logo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Samsung Galaxy M34 device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Samsung Galaxy M34 device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Samsung Galaxy M34 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Samsung Galaxy M34 device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Samsung Galaxy M34 device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Samsung Galaxy M34 Y2 and Samsung Galaxy M34 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built.

### App Troubles

If your **phone is working, but the screen is black,** there’s also a high probability that you are having an isolated issue with a particular application. An app could be loading something, which often happens for streaming apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime, and more, especially if you have slow internet connectivity.

### Software Issues

A potential reason why **your phone screen went black but still works** could be because of your smartphone’s software. This problem suggests that your Samsung Galaxy M34 is crashing, potentially freezing your device if not addressed immediately. If this is the cause, then your device is likely experiencing a critical system error, and you should directly try to reboot your phone.

### Hardware Problem

If you dropped your phone, there’s a high chance the LCD connectors went loose due to the physical impact. If this happened to you, the phone might be working, but the screen is black due to the LCD cable dislodging. Another issue could be your phone got exposed to extreme temperatures. This can also cause a **black screen but your phone is still on.**

### Method 2: Uninstall or Update Outdated Applications

In some cases, your **phone screen is black but still works** because of installing incompatible apps on your iOS/Android device. If the installed app is frequently crashing, it may be the source of a blank cell phone **screen.** Uninstall the problem app to see if the black screen disappears or not.

### Method 3: Inspect the LCD Connectors

If **your phone screen goes black but still works,** you should inspect the logic board to the LCD screen to see if it has become disconnected. It is common for smartphones that often get dropped a few times. It’s best to plug the connectors back to regain your screen’s functionality.

However, this requires technical know-how. It’s better to seek help from a professional as you could risk causing more damage to your device if you don’t know what you’re doing.

### Method 4: Perform a Factory Reset
