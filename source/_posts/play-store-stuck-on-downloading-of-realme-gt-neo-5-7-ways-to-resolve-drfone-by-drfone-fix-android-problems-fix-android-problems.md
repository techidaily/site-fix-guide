- Take apart your Realme GT Neo 5 and clean it routinely to avoid dust and lint from clogging the phone and overheating it.

**II. Software**

- It is recommended to download apps from Google Play Store. This way, you can be sure that your app comes from a trusted source.
- Read the app’s permission to see which part of the operating system and your personal information that you are giving access to.
- Install reliable anti-virus and anti-malware software to safeguard your Realme GT Neo 5 from malicious attacks.
- Make sure you update your operating system, software and apps to make sure you have the latest version – the developer may have fixed the bugs that have caused problems on Android phones.

It is important to note that your phone contains some important data. Therefore, when your Realme GT Neo 5 won't turn on do not just give up - there are plenty of tools at your disposal to recover back your files and phone.
