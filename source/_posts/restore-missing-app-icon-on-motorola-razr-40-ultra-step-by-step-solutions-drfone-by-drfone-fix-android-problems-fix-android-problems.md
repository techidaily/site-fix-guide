Another way to avoid Motorola Razr 40 Ultra Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device from physical damage. Using a protective case or screen protector can help prevent cracks or scratches on the screen that can lead to unresponsiveness.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra App Store.
