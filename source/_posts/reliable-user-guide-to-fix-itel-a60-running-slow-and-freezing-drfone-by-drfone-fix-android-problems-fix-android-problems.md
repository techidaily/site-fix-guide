## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Itel A60 device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Itel A60 device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Itel A60 device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Itel A60 contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Itel A60 device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Itel A60 device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Itel A60 is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Itel A60 is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Itel A60s.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Itel A60 is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Itel A60 device. So if your Itel A60 is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Itel A60 device’s animation type and speed on your Itel A60 via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Itel A60 to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Itel A60 is running slow and freezing, the Itel A60 device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

**Tip:** If you hold down the power button for a few seconds, you will see the “Power Off” and “Restart” options on the screen. You can’t use it because the entire screen isn’t responding. Hence, you should press and hold the “Power” button for as long as necessary.

### Turn On Safe Mode

You should switch to Safe mode whenever an application or piece of software causes a problem on your device. Only the most fundamental system components are loaded and used when operating in Safe mode.

****Step 1:**** To force a restart, press and hold the Itel A60 device’s “Power” button for an extended period.

### Turn Off Developer Options

Every smartphone is bound to have limitations. However, smartphone makers include a “Developer Options” menu for advanced users. Here, restrictions are removed, and user preferences can be customized.

If you enable Developer Options on some Android devices, they may stop working properly. If you have recently activated Developer Options and your touchscreen is no longer responding as expected, you should disable it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

****Step 2:**** Select the ****System**** menu item, which usually locates at the bottom of the screen.

****Step 5:**** Restart your device to check if the part of the touch screen not working issue has been resolved.

### Reset Device to Factory Settings

Resetting your device to its factory settings will return it to its state when you first unboxed it. All your phone’s data and installed apps will be erased, including any malware on your device that may be causing the issue to occur. Here’s how to restore your device to factory settings:

****Step 1:**** Since your touch screen is not working, you can factory reset it using Google’s Find My Device web service.

****Step 3:**** After successfully logging in, you will see your device’s name. Select the ****Erase Device**** option.

## Part 1: Learn Why Unfortunately the process.com.android.phone Has Stopped

The error message "****Unfortunately,**** ****the process com.android.phone has stopped****" typically appears on Android devices when there is an issue with the Phone app. Issues with underlying processes responsible for handling phone-related functions are also a cause.

![process com.android.phone has stopped error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/process-com-android-1.jpg)

It can prevent you from making or receiving phone calls, accessing contacts, or using other phone-related features. Following are some of the possible reasons why you may encounter this error:

### App or System Update

When you update your device's OS or the Phone app itself, it is possible to encounter bugs or compatibility issues. These issues can lead to the Phone app crashing and displaying this error message. Sometimes, the updated software may not work with the existing configurations of the Phone app. It results in instability which causes this error.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### App Cache/Data Corruption

The Phone app relies on cached data and stored settings to function properly. If the cache or data of the app becomes corrupted, it can cause the Phone app to malfunction. The reasons include interrupted app installations or updates, improper shutdowns, or software conflicts. As a result, you may see the error message indicating that the process com.android.phone has stopped.

### Insufficient System Resources

Android devices need sufficient memory (RAM) and processing power to run apps smoothly. If your device is running low on memory or processing capacity, it may struggle to handle the Phone app and its processes. It can lead to crashes and the error message.
