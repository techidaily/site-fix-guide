## Part 4: Update software to the latest version to fix Android phone keeps turning off

Software glitches or outdated operating systems can trigger automatic shutdowns on Android phones. Updating your Oppo K11x's software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.

To update the software on your Oppo K11x, follow these steps:

Go to "Settings" on your Oppo K11x and navigate to the "System" or "Software Update" section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to "Check for updates" to see if any new software updates are available.

![update software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off.jpg)

## Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off

When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Oppo K11x device's internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone's internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.

To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.

## Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode

Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function. If you can use your phone in Safe Mode, consider deleting the unnecessary Apps which may be burdening the phone’s processor.

To boot into Safe Mode:

Long press the power button to see the following options on the screen.

![device options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529157169.jpeg)

Now tap on “Power Off” for about 10 seconds and click “OK” on the message that pops-up as shown below.

![safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529389258.jpg)

Once done, the phone will reboot and you will see “Safe Mode” on the main screen.

![safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529591962.jpg)

That's all. Well, booting to Safe Mode is easy and it also helps you to identify the real problem.
