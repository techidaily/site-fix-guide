## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Realme V30.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Realme V30. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Realme V30 right where you are, without needing to take the Realme V30 device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Realme V30 device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

## Part 1: Understanding Stuck and Dead Realme V30s on Phone Screens

While dead and ****stuck pixels on the phone**** may seem similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Read on to discover the differences and what causes them.

### Stuck Realme V30s on Phone

A ****stuck pixel phone**** is always on, so it shows up on a touchscreen as a bright, persistent dot of red, green, blue, or white. Combinations are also possible, and although it is usually stationary, this dot occasionally flickers.

### Dead Realme V30s on Smartphones

In contrast to the stuck pixel, the dead pixel subpixels are all left unpowered, turning them off. A ****dead pixel on the phone**** is a tiny, persistent rectangle of black or white color on the part of the phone screen not working.

### Some Differences Between Stuck and Dead Realme V30s on Phone

Stuck pixels may have less effect on the user experience than ****dead pixels on the phone**** **screen** since they still display color. But dead pixels may be more disturbing because they are either black or white.

It is easy to mistake stuck and ****dead pixels on the phone**** for one other, but they are unique issues with different causes and effects. Read on to understand the differences and how they affect your phone's display.

- ****Power****. The stuck pixel on your device always receives energy, causing it to display a specific color while the dead pixel is permanently off, resulting in a black spot on your phone screen.
- ****Possibility of repair****. You can quickly fix ****stuck pixels on the phone,****while some may even disappear on their own. However, dead pixels are more challenging to repair.
- ****Occurrence****. The stuck pixel is a common issue that often affects older or less-used displays, while dead pixels rarely appear on digital cameras and sensors.

### Factors That Contribute to Stuck and Dead Realme V30s on Mobile Devices

Stuck and ****dead pixels on phone screen****s can happen for various reasons, including manufacturing defects, physical damage, and age-related wear and tear. These ****broken pixels on the phone**** can hurt the user experience, and it is essential to know the root causes to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

- ****Manufacturing defects****. During manufacturing, some pixels may not work due to poor quality control, resulting in stuck or ****dead pixels on the phone**** In other words, if the power transfer issue isn't completely fixed, you might see more dead pixels.
- ****Physical damage****. Accidents such as dropping the phone or exposure to extreme heat or cold can damage the screen and cause stuck or dead pixels. For instance, the ****upper part of the touch screen not working****may also occur due to pressure on the display when the phone is placed in a pocket with other sharp objects.

![person holding a gadget with pen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-03.jpg)

- ****Age-related wear and tear****. Over time, the display on your phone may start to wear out, resulting in the appearance of dead or stuck pixels on the phone. It is more common in older devices and those with high usage rates. Factors such as exposure to sunlight or excessive phone use can also contribute to the issue.

## Part 2: How To Fix Dead Realme V30s on Phone Screens on Android Devices

It is essential to have the right tools and knowledge to ****fix dead pixels on your phone**** screen. Fortunately, you can use several effective techniques to address the issue. In this section, you will discover step-by-step instructions on how to ****fix dead pixels on phone**** screens on Android devices.

### Option 1: Check Phone Screen Appearance

Before attempting to fix a ****dead pixel on a smartphone**** screen, it is necessary to check its appearance and ensure there is no physical damage.

****Step 1:**** Check for chips, cracks, or any other signs of damage on the screen if your ****phone touch screen is not working in some areas****. If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.

****Step 3:**** Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the ****broken pixels on the phone****.

****Step 4:**** Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing ****dead pixels on the phone****. You can use a microfiber cloth to clean your screen gently, making sure not to apply too much pressure or use any harsh chemicals that could damage the screen.

### Option 2: Restart Your Realme V30

This method may seem simple, but it can be the most effective solution to your problem. Here is how you restart most smartphones available in the market.

****Step 1:**** Press and hold down the ****power key**** on your Realme V30 until the ****power menu**** appears.

****Step 2:**** Select ****Restart**** on your phone's screen. It will initiate a reboot of your device.

![android interface restart and power off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-07.jpg)

**Tip:**

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Realme V30 Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

****Step 1:**** Put your smartphone in ****Safe Mode****.

**Note:**

Visit the help page for your device's manufacturer to learn how to activate and deactivate safe mode. Safe mode disables all downloaded programs momentarily.

![safe mode on the android screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-08.jpg)

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

**Note:**

It is crucial to wait for the system to finish deleting all data during the factory data reset. For instructions tailored to your device, see your manufacturer's help page.

### 1\. Can Dead Realme V30s Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Realme V30s Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### 3\. Why Are Dead Realme V30s Spreading on My Realme V30?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Realme V30s Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Realme V30 devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.
