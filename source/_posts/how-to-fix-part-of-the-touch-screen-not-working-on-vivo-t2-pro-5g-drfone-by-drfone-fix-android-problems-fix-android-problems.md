### 1\. Protect from Malware

The first thing to protect your Vivo T2 Pro 5G smartphone from getting stuck on the boot is to keep it safe from unauthorized and malicious data. The best thing to keep a device secure is to follow all security protocols and avoid bypassing them. If you try downloading something not authorized by the Play Store itself, for instance, an APK, it can make your device vulnerable to malware.

### 2\. Keep Your Device Updated

If you feel frustrated by issues like ****Vivo T2 Pro 5G being stuck on the Android One screen,**** the best thing to avoid such a problem is to keep your device updated at all costs.

Modifying a single file can make your device useless or put you in situations like a Vivo T2 Pro 5G smartphone stuck on the boot. For that, the best tip is to keep yourself out of engagement.

### 4\. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone To Manage All Data With Ease
