### Fix 7: Perform Factory Reset

If all previous fixes have been unsuccessful, performing a factory reset is also an option to resolve this issue. It is a drastic measure that can potentially address underlying software issues. However, it's important to note that a factory reset will erase the entire data and settings of your device.

So, it's crucial to back up your important files before proceeding with this fix. By doing so, you can restore your device to its original state and eliminate the error. Use the detailed guide described below to factory reset your Poco X6 Pro:

- ****Step 1:**** Start by launching the Settings app and selecting "General Management." Here, choose "Reset," and following that on the next screen, tap "Factory data reset."
