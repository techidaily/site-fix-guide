## Reset Factory Settings of this Device

When nothing works, the last resort you can go with is resetting the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device to factory state. Doing this will remove any sort of conflicting bugs and other stuff. However, this will remove the data from your device. So make sure to backup everything before going with this method. The steps are:

- Open “Settings” and tap “Backup & reset”.
- Go to “Factory data reset” and tap “Reset phone”
