### Fix 6: Check the SD card

If you are still getting the **process system isn’t responding** to Android error, then chances are that there could be an issue with your SD card. Firstly, check if your SD card is working fine or not. If it is corrupted, then get another memory card for your phone. Also, it should have a prominent amount of free storage. You might be facing this issue if the SD card has limited free space.

Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.

One of the easiest ways to do it is by using the SuperSU app.

You can always download either SuperSU or SuperSU Pro app from its website [here](https://supersuroot.org/). Simply install it on our device and launch it whenever you wish to unroot it. Visit its “Settings” tab and select the option of “Full unroot”.

After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.
