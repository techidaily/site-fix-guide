## Part 3. Check Wi-Fi Router settings

The third step you’ll want to take is making sure the internet router in your house is working properly and is actually sending internet data to your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G. Of course, if you have other internet-enabled devices connected to the same router and they’re working fine, you know this isn’t the problem.

However, if you’ve got a problem with Wi-Fi not working on your Android and other devices in your home or office, you know you’ve got a router problem. Here’s how to solve it.

1. Go to your internet router and check the indicator lights
2. While this depends on your device, a green or blue light will mean the connection is good, whereas a red light indicates a problem
3. Press the Restart button on your router and wait ten minutes before reconnecting your device and connecting again
4. Call up your internet provider to see if there’s an internet connection issue in your area
5. Open your web browser and log into your router settings to ensure your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G is connected to the Wi-Fi network and is allowed to send and receive data

## Part 4. Boot your Android in safe mode

![wifi not working on android - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-safe-mode.jpg)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, but other devices have no issues, you may find the issues is coming from within your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G itself. Fortunately, there are ways you can see whether this is the problem.

The best way to do this is to boot your device in Safe Mode. The process for doing this will depend on the make and model of your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G, but the basic process goes as follows;

1. Turn off your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G by holding down the Power button and tapping Power Off. Wait a few minutes to ensure the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device is completely off
2. Press and hold the Power button to turn your phone on, but the press and hold both the volume up and volume down buttons at the same time
3. You will see the words ‘Safe Mode’ appear on your screen as the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device loads
4. Now you will be booted in Safe Mode. Try connecting to the internet again to see if it works

If your device connects to the internet while in Safe Mode, you’ll know you have a problem with an app or service that’s running on your device. If this is the case, you’ll need to go through your apps and delete them and then reinstall them one at a time until you find the app or service that is causing your internet problems.

## Part 5. Check the Android Wi-Fi adapter

![wifi not working on android - check adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-wifi-adapter.jpeg)

If you’re using a Wi-Fi adapter on your device to connect to the internet, you’ll need to make sure this is working. This could be an adapter on your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G itself, especially if you’re using an older device, or if you’re using an adapter to boost the ranger of your router network.

You need to check both of these to make sure your connection is working properly.

1. If using an Android Wi-Fi adapter, make sure all the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device drivers are up to date, and if you’re using an app, make sure the app is updated, and all the settings allow an internet connection
2. If you’re using a router adapter, make sure it’s set up properly, and your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G is connected to the adapter using the correct passwords. Try connecting another device to see if the internet connection is working on there
3. Whichever method you’re using, try disconnecting your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G and forgetting the network, and then reconnecting and entering the right password to refresh the connection

## Part 6. Check SSID and IP address on Android

To make a Wi-Fi connection work, your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G needs to match two codes that connect and relate to your router to establish the connection and work correctly. These are known as the SSID and the IP address.

Every wireless device will have its own codes and making sure they’re matched to the network you’re connecting to is crucial to ensuring the internet is working on your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G. Here’s how to check on your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to make sure everything is correct.

1. Tap the Settings menu option, followed by Wi-Fi on your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G
2. Turn on your Wi-Fi network and connect it to your router
3. Find the router name (SSID) and make sure it’s exactly the same as the SSID written on your router
4. Once connected, tap the Wi-Fi network and you will see the IP address. Check both your phone and the router codes to make sure this number matches

When these numbers are matching, if your Android is still not connecting to wifi, you’ll know this wasn’t the problem.

## Part 7. Fix Android system issues in one click

### Cache Buildup

Accumulated cache data can hamper app performance, leading to frequent crashes. [Clear the cache](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-iphone/clear-iphone-cache.html) of the Pandora app. Usually, you can see this option under **Settings > Apps** > **Clear Data.** Additionally, you can optimize your device’s RAM and storage space by deleting unnecessary files or closing unused apps.

### Device Compatibility Issues

Outdated system software can create compatibility issues, causing app instability. Ensure your device’s system software is up-to-date. Check for and install any pending system updates in your device’s settings. Updated software often includes [bug fixes](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/fix-ios-17-keyborad-bug-and-autocorrect-issue.html) and improvements that can rectify compatibility-related crashes.

If the problems persist, contacting Pandora support or seeking professional assistance might be advisable to delve deeper into the technical aspects of the app’s performance issues.

## Part 3: What To Do if None of the Fixes Work

- **Contact customer support.**Reach out to Pandora’s customer support for tailored assistance. They may offer specific troubleshooting steps or insights into the app’s technical glitches.
- **Consider a new phone.** Upgrade to a new phone if the crashes persist despite troubleshooting, and your device is outdated or incompatible. This might help resolve the issue by providing a more stable environment for app usage.
