![camera not working error in android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg)

## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Camera.

![set camera permissions android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg)

Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

![clear camera app cache android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg)

### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

### II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)

Now, if the above fixes have not worked, you might want to repair your Android OS once before you make that appointment with the service centre. And, we have just the app to help you fix your camera not working on Android problem quickly.

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.

### Check carefully for duplicate Wi-Fi names before you connect

Perhaps, you might connect to a WiFi with a similar name. There are good chances that some users do not modify their WiFi network name and possibly, your neighbor may have the same WiFi network, service provider. Therefore, ensure you connect to the correct WiFi network.

### Reset the Wifi network

One of the easiest ways to fix the authentication problem of Wifi is to reset the network. To do this, you would be required to forget the respective network first and then connect to it again. This can be done by simply following these steps.

1\. Firstly, you need to forget a Wifi network. To do it, go to your phone’s Settings > WiFi and network. From here, you can see a list of all the Wifi hotspots that your phone connects to. Select the network you wish to forget.

2\. When you would select a network, it will provide the basic information related to it. Just tap on the “Forget” button and agree to the pop-up message. This will erase the network’s information from your device.

3\. Afterward, turn on your Wifi again and tap to the network you wish to connect to. Simply provide the credentials and tap on the “Connect” button to reestablish the connection. This way, you can reset the network successfully.

### Modify network connection

If the above solution won’t work, then you would be required to walk the extra mile to fix the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G Wifi problem. After you reset a network connection, if still getting issues regarding the authentication of the network, you need to modify the connection. In this technique, you will be changing the IP settings on your phone to alter the way it establishes a secure connection. You can do it by following these steps.

1\. To start with, visit your phone’s Settings and open the Wifi page.

![open the Wifi page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981518727215.jpg)

2\. This will display a list of all the Wifi networks that are associated with your device. Just long-tap on the Wifi network that you wish to modify. It will open another pop-up window. From here, tap on the option of “Manage network settings”. Sometimes, users also get an option of “Modify network settings” here as well. Simply select it to proceed.

![Modify network settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981519057338.jpg)

3\. It will display basic information related to your Wifi network. Just tap on the “Show advanced options” button to access more options related to the network setting.

![Show advanced options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981519311624.jpg)

4\. From the IP Settings menu, change the field from DHCP to Static. This will let you establish a static connection between your device and the router.

![change the field](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981520827015.jpg)

5\. As soon as you will change it to static, you will get different fields related to your network’s IP address, gateway, DNS, and more. Simply fill these fields and tap on the “Save” button once you are done.

![fill these fields](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521159129.jpg)

Now, try to connect to the Wifi hotspot again. You would be able to overcome the authentication problem of Wifi.

### Change Network Security Type

It has been observed that, when we connect to Wifi, our device chooses a wrong security type. This clashes with the default security protocol of the router and authentication error occurred due to this. If your device is facing the same issue, then it can be fixed by simply changing its security type. To do this, follow these instructions:

1\. To change the security type of a network, you need to “Add the network”. If you already have the Wifi network saved, then simply forget the network by following the above-mentioned tutorial.

2\. Now, turn on your device’s Wifi and tap on the option of “Add network”. Here, you would be asked to give a network name and select the security type. To manually select it, tap on the “Security” option.

![tap on the “Security”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521984185.jpg)

3\. From here, you will get a list of various security protocols that you can pick. Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK” and save your selection.

![Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981522445076.jpg)

Now, try to connect to the network again. Most likely, it will let you fix the authentication error on your device.

### Update Android firmware to the latest

There are instances where an outdated OS version of your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G may create a hindrance in establishing a connection between your device and the WiFi network. You need to update your Android firmware to the latest version and then check if the problem persists or not.

Step 1: Launch “Settings” of your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G and then get into the “About Phone” option.

Step 2: Now, opt for the “System Update” option. If the update is available, get your device updated to the latest OS version.

### Restart the router and reset Android network settings

Sometimes, the WiFi router may hang up while establishing a connection and therefore, the wifi authentication problem occurs. Try restarting your Wi-Fi router and then check if your device connects successfully. If this doesn’t work, try to [reset your Android Network Settings](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html#reset).

### Bonus tip: Turn Airplane mode on/off

By simply turning on the Airplane mode (and later turning it off), you can easily fix the authentication problem Wifi most of the time. You can find a toggle button for Airplane mode on the notification bar of your phone. If you can’t find it there, then go to your phone’s Settings > Connection > More Networks and turn on the feature of “Airplane Mode”.

![go to Connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981523333039.jpg)

Let it do for a while. Afterward, turn it off and try to connect to the Wifi network again.

After following these quick and easy suggestions, you would be able to fix the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G Wifi problem for sure. Even if you use any other Android device, then its authentication error can easily be resolved after these effective solutions.
