## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Samsung Galaxy S23 device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Samsung Galaxy S23 device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

### Fix 6: Check the SD card

If you are still getting the **process system isn’t responding** to Android error, then chances are that there could be an issue with your SD card. Firstly, check if your SD card is working fine or not. If it is corrupted, then get another memory card for your phone. Also, it should have a prominent amount of free storage. You might be facing this issue if the SD card has limited free space.

Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.

Though, this should be your last resort, as it will wipe off your device’s data entirely. Even if you are performing a factory reset, make sure that you back up your data by using a reliable tool like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).

![reset phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980670512565.jpg)

If your device is not functioning or locked, then you can perform the factory reset operation by putting your phone into Recovery mode.

### Fix 9: Unroot the Samsung Galaxy S23 device

It has been further discovered that the process system isn’t responding error is more common in rooted devices. Therefore, if you also have a rooted Android device, then you can choose to unroot it in order to fix this issue. There are different ways to unroot an Android device. One of the easiest ways to do it is by using the SuperSU app.

You can always download either SuperSU or SuperSU Pro app from its website [here](https://supersuroot.org/). Simply install it on our device and launch it whenever you wish to unroot it. Visit its “Settings” tab and select the option of “Full unroot”.

![full unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671048148.jpg)

This will generate a warning message regarding all the repercussions of the unrooting process. Just tap on “Continue” to initiate the process.

![continue unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671247132.jpg)

If you are using an older version of Android, then you might get another pop-up to restore boot images. Simply make the desired selection and start the process. After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.

![restore stock boot image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671431228.jpg)

Now that you know different ways to fix the **process system not responding** error, you can easily overcome this issue and make the most out of your device. Simply start with the easy fixes, and if they don’t work, then take extreme measures like unrooting your device or restoring it to factory setting. Also, make sure to back up your data before taking any extreme measures.
