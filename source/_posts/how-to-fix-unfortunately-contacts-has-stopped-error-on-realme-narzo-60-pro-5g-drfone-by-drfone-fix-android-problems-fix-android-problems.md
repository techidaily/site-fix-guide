## Part 3: Safe mode on Android FAQs

In this section, we’ll discuss some frequently asked questions about the safe mode. Some users have many questions regarding the safe mode. Here we’ll try to cover some of them.

**1\. Why is My Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G on safe mode?**

This is a very common question around the world. For many Android device users, it’s quite common to see your phone in safe mode suddenly. Android is a secure platform and if your device sees any threat from your recently installed apps or any programs that want to harm your device; it would go into safe mode automatically. Sometimes, you might accidentally perform the steps discussed in part 2 and boot your device in safe mode.

**2\. Safe mode won't turn off on My Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G**

For the solution to remove safe mode from your device you must follow the step-by-step methods as mentioned in part 1. This will surely take your device out of the safe mode.

The safe mode is a very useful program for any Android device. But it limits the programs of Android and you must remove safe mode after uninstalling the harmful app. This article showed you how to turn off safe mode easily.
