## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Honor Magic 5 Pro device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Honor Magic 5 Pro device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.

If your system is updated, then Spotify might need an update. The app might malfunction if you’re using an older version. Thus, updating the app might solve the Spotify crashing problem. You can update Spotify by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the **Play Store**.

![play store on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-14.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Search and open Spotify in the Play Store.
- **Step 3:** Tap Update

### 8. Free up Storage

Spotify can start crashing if your Android’s storage space is at capacity. That can also cause other apps to crash, not only Spotify. Therefore, check the storage space and free up as much as possible. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Here, you can see how much of your storage space is available and what’s taking up the most space.

![available storage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-17.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Then, you can go ahead and clear as much space as you can.

### 9. Reinstall Spotify

There’s another solution if the Spotify app keeps crashing. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling it again on your Android. That will reset the app and might solve your problem. Follow the next steps to reinstall Spotify:

- **Step 1:** Find the Spotify app on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Hold the app icon.
- **Step 3:** Then, press **Uninstall**.

![uninstall spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-18.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Press **OK**.
- **Step 5:** Then, open the PlayStore and find Spotify.
- **Step 6:** Tap **Install**to reinstall the app again.

- **Step 7:** Once it installs, log in to test if it’s working.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several websites that check real-time app servers and if they’re down.

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **Apps**.
- **Step 3:** Find **Spotify** and tap it.

![spotify in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-23.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Tap **Storage**or **Storage usage**.
