## Part 3: How to disable Google Play Service?

By now, you already know all the repercussions of getting rid of Google Play Services permanently. Before you learn how to update Play Store after uninstalling updates, be sure whether you wish to uninstall Google Play Services or not. You can also choose to simply disable the services as well. If you face any severe issue afterward, then you can always enable the services manually.

To disable the Google Play Services, just go to your phone’s Settings > Applications > All and open Google Play Services. You will get to know about the app’s detail and a few other options here. Just tap on the “Disable” button. It will generate another pop-up message. Confirm it by tapping on the “Ok” button. This will disable Google Play Services on your device. Later, you can follow the same drill to enable it as well.
