## 8 Workable Fixes to the SIM not provisioned MM#2 Error on Lava Blaze Curve 5G

SIM cards are small chips that act as a connecting medium between your cell phone and your carrier. It is programmed to help your carrier identify your cell phone account with certain information. And eventually, you are enabled to make calls and to make use of mobile internet. Now, if your device is showing “SIM not provisioned” on Android then it signifies that the connection to carrier network cannot be established or perhaps, your carrier isn’t able to identify your cell phone account.


## Part 1. Why does the error “SIM not provisioned MM#2” pop up?

There can be numerous reasons behind the pop up that reads “SIM not provisioned” on Android. But basically, it most probably affects the users who have registered a new SIM card. If you get to experience this issue in other situations or if the SIM is not working in Android, then the problem is with the SIM card and needs to be replaced. Anyways, here is a list of situations when the “SIM not provisioned” error may bother you.

- You got a new SIM card for your new phone.
- You are transferring your contacts into the new SIM card.
- In case, the carrier network provider’s authorization server is unavailable.
- Perhaps, you’re out of the reach of the carrier coverage area and that too, without active roaming agreement.
- Though new SIM cards work flawlessly. But it is often necessary to get your SIM card activated due to security reasons.

Just in case, you haven’t bought any new SIM card and the one you were using was working fine until now, then the most probable reasons behind it could be listed below:

- If your SIM card is too old, possibly it might have gone dead, try replacing it.
- Perhaps, the SIM card was not properly inserted into the slot or there might be some dirt between the SIM and smartphone pins.

A yet another reason could be that your SIM card got deactivated by your carrier provider as it could have been locked to a particular phone. Now, if you insert such a SIM card to another device or a new device even, you may get to witness a message that reads “SIM not valid”.

### 2.3 Insert the SIM card correctly

If your SIM card was working properly until yet, there is a good possibility that the SIM card may have moved a bit from its actual location. Eventually, there is poor contact between the SIM card pins and the circuit. Try inserting your SIM card properly with the following steps.

- Power off your Lava Blaze Curve 5G and with the help of Q pin, eject the SIM card holder from the SIM slot of your device.
- Now, grab a soft rubber pencil eraser and gently rub it in on the gold pins of SIM card to clean them properly. Then, with the help of a soft cloth wipe away the rubber residue from the SIM card.
- Next, push the SIM back into the SIM card holder properly and push it back into the SIM slot now.
- Turn your device back on and look if your SIM not provisioned on the Android issue is resolved or not.

### 2.4 Activate the SIM card

Usually, when you buy a new SIM card, it gets automatically activated within 24 hours of being plugged into a new device. But if that’s not happening in your case and you’re wondering how to activate SIM card, make use of the three options below to enable activation:

- Call your carrier service provider
- Send an SMS
- Log on to your carrier’s website and look for the activation page over it.

Note: The aforementioned options are straightforward and are quick ways to enable activation. It depends on your carrier network whether they support them.

Be patient while they investigate the issue. It may eat up a heck load of time or may get resolved in a few minutes that completely depend upon the complexity of the issue.

### 2.6 Try the other SIM card slot

A yet another reason why SIM not working in Android can be because of the SIM card slot might have gone corrupted. Thanks to the dual SIM technology, you do not have to rush immediately to get it to check or repair. You can simply rule out this possibility by ejecting the SIM card from its original SIM slot and then replacing it into the other SIM card slot.

## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

![charging cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459762305.jpg)

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device.

![clean charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985460097930.jpg)

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Lava Blaze Curve 5G won't charge the issue.

### 4\. Try another power source

This technique is more like a quick trick. It means to switch from one power source to another or use a more efficient and suitable power source.

In such a scenario, choose to charge your device by directly plugging it into a socket on the wall to never experience My Lava Blaze Curve 5G won't charge problem.

### 5\. Clear device Cache

Clearing Cache is a great technique as it cleans your device and all its partitions. By clearing the cache, all the unwanted data and files stored in your device get deleted, which may be causing glitches in the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device’s software, preventing it from recognizing the current.

Follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:
