### Part 2: Movement Simulation Between two Places

Step 1: Launch the tool and look for the first icon at the upper right screen which is “one-stop route”. Choose the place you want to travel on the map. You will know the distance in the pop-up box.

Step 2: The slider located below the screen needs to be dragged to set the speed of travelling. You can choose cycling speed or the speed you want. Hit on “Move Here” afterwards.

Step 4: Now, the position will be seen moving as per the chosen speed on the map. And this is how you can fake the movement sans **_Fake GPS Go apk_**.

### Part 3: Simulate Route Movement for Multiple Locations

Step 1: For multiple spots, you need to click the “multi-stop route” after entering map interface. This mode is the second icon on the upper right side. Now, select the multiple places one by one where you want to pass.

Step 2: The pop-up will show the distance where you need to hit the “Move Here” button. Choose the moving speed.
