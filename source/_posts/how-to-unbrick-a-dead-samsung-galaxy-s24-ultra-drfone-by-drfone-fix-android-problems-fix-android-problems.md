Discovering your phone died, especially among Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra models, can be disheartening. Looking online for ways to **unbrick your Oneplus 8T** can take up so much of your time. The unavailability of your device can disrupt your routine and connectivity. However, unbricking is the crucial solution to regain the functionality of your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device.

This guide teaches effective methods to **unbrick your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**. The page will also discuss the early warning signs and healthy habits to prolong your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Read below to learn more.

## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.
- **Unexpected Reboots and Crashes.**Frequent and unprovoked reboots, app crashes, and system instability might point toward software inconsistencies. Similar to consistent black screens, this could eventually lead to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.

#### Unauthorized User Modifications

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.

This can happen to various models, such as the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Protecting the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

Another way to avoid Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Screen unresponsiveness is by protecting the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device from physical damage.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues.

To try fixing an Android Phone that won’t turn on, follow these steps:

1. For any Android devices, remove the battery (considering the battery of your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra can be removed) and leave it out for at least 30 minutes. Put back the battery in and try to turn it on.
2. Press and hold down the **Power** and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time for 15-30 minutes to reboot the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device.
3. Should the first two steps do not work, charge your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra to get it out of the start-up loop. You can also opt to use a different battery, just in case your current battery is the source of the problem.
4. If there are any connected hardware e.g. SD card, remove them from the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device.
5. Start your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in **Safe Mode** by pressing and holding down the **Menu** or **Volume Down** button on your device.
6. Should the first five steps do not work for you, perform a hard reset. Do take note that each device will have a different way to do so and that data that is stored locally on the phone will be deleted.
7. Send your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra to the repair shop should none of these steps work.
