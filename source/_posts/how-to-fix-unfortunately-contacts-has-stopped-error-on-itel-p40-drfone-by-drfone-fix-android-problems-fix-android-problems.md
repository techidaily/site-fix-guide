Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Itel P40, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

4. If the Itel P40 devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Itel P40

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Itel P40 devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Itel P40 to the Itel P40 device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

## Part 4: People Also Ask

Some common questions you should know when taking care of an unresponsive phone touchscreen are listed below.

### 1\. Why Did My iPhone Screen Go Black After Not Responding to Touch?

Your iPhone screen with a **touch issue** will sometimes go black after not responding to touch due to several issues. It could be hardware, software, issues with a particular app, software crash, or you have a low battery. If it’s a drained battery, you’re in luck; all you have to do is charge it. Otherwise, you’ll have to perform a force restart on your iPhone to try to reboot it.

### 2\. How Do I Keep My Android From Crashing?

Keeping your apps updated should help you solve app crashing issues that can impact your Android OS. These apps build up large caches throughout your normal usage. Clearing cached data from time to time can drastically improve your smartphone’s performance and prevent **touch issues**. To remove your app cache, go to **Settings** \> **Storage** and tap **Cached Data**.

### 3\. Can I Use Dr.Fone for Free?

Wondershare Dr.Fone for iOS and Android is free to download and install. You can also test the first few steps and see if the program supports your device. However, when you click the **Fix Now** button to start the repair process, you will be required to enter a valid license to activate the program.
