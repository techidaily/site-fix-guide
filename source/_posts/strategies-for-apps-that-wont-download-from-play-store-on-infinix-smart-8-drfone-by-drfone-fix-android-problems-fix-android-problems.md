If your device is not functioning or locked, then you can perform the factory reset operation by putting your phone into Recovery mode. Most of the time, it can be done by pressing the Power and Volume up button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. Though, the key combinations might change from one device to another.

After entering the Recovery mode, go to the “wipe data/factory reset” option using the Volume up and down button. Use the Power button to make a selection. If you get an additional message, then select the “yes – delete all data” option. When it is done, you can simply reboot your device.
