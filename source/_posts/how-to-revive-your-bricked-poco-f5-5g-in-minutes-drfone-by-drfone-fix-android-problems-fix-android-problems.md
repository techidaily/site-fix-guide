Similarly, [HTC](https://drfone.wondershare.com/htc/htc-recovery-mode.html) and LG device users are supposed to press the “Volume Down” and “Power” buttons. For Nexus, it is “Volume Up, Down” and Power key combinations. Therefore, before going further, make sure what device you own and enter the recovery mode according to it.
