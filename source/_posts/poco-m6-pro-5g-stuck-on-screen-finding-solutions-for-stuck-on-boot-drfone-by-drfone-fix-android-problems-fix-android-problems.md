This can happen to various models, such as the Poco M6 Pro 5G, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Poco M6 Pro 5G device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Poco M6 Pro 5G F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Poco M6 Pro 5G device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Poco M6 Pro 5G Reno and Find X.
