## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Realme C67 4G device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

It is also very commonly observed that the charging end of the cable which gets connected to the charging port of the Realme C67 4G device gets damaged and prevents the current from flowing to the phone/tablet.

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Realme C67 4G device.

The best way to take this problem is to clean the port with a blunt pin or a soft bristle unused toothbrush. Make sure you clean the port gently and do not damage it or its sensors.

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Realme C67 4G won't charge the issue.

### 4\. Try another power source

This technique is more like a quick trick. It means to switch from one power source to another or use a more efficient and suitable power source. Laptops and PCs charge slower than a direct power source, i.e., a wall socket. Sometimes, the charging speed is slower, and the battery is draining. In such a scenario, choose to charge your device by directly plugging it into a socket on the wall to never experience My Realme C67 4G won't charge problem.

### 5\. Clear device Cache

Clearing Cache is a great technique as it cleans your device and all its partitions. By clearing the cache, all the unwanted data and files stored in your device get deleted, which may be causing glitches in the Realme C67 4G device’s software, preventing it from recognizing the current.

Follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:

• Visit “Settings” and find “Storage”

Try charging your phone after clearing the cache. If your phone doesn't charge even now, do not worry. There are more ways to help you combat My Realme C67 4G won't charge problem.

### 6\. Re-start/reboot your phone/tablet

### 7\. Download and install the Ampere App

The Ampere app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. It is very helpful to fix the why won't my charge error as it gives you real-time information about your device’s battery consumption, charging status, and other essential data.

Installing your Android version updates is a good idea as the software is the interface that receives charge from the charging port sensors and gives a command for the phone/tablet to charge. People often continue to use older OS versions, which cause trouble and prevent the Realme C67 4G device from charging.

To check for and install updates on your device, you must be connected to WiFi or a cellular network. Next, visit “Settings” and select “About device”. Now click on “Software Update”.
