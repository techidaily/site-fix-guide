## Part 4: People Also Ask

Some common questions you should know when taking care of an unresponsive phone touchscreen are listed below.

### 1\. Why Did My iPhone Screen Go Black After Not Responding to Touch?

Your iPhone screen with a **touch issue** will sometimes go black after not responding to touch due to several issues. It could be hardware, software, issues with a particular app, software crash, or you have a low battery. If it’s a drained battery, you’re in luck; all you have to do is charge it. Otherwise, you’ll have to perform a force restart on your iPhone to try to reboot it.

### 2\. How Do I Keep My Android From Crashing?

Keeping your apps updated should help you solve app crashing issues that can impact your Android OS. These apps build up large caches throughout your normal usage. Clearing cached data from time to time can drastically improve your smartphone’s performance and prevent **touch issues**. To remove your app cache, go to **Settings** \> **Storage** and tap **Cached Data**.

### 3\. Can I Use Dr.Fone for Free?

Wondershare Dr.Fone for iOS and Android is free to download and install. You can also test the first few steps and see if the program supports your device. However, when you click the **Fix Now** button to start the repair process, you will be required to enter a valid license to activate the program.
