It is the best and last solution if other fixes haven't worked and you can't pinpoint the reason. Factory resetting your Honor Magic5 Ultimate will delete all phone data. Thus, you should create a proper backup before trying this fix. Follow these steps to factory reset your Honor Magic5 Ultimate in no time:

### Solution 6. Replace the Old Screen with A New Screen

If none of the above-mentioned fixes have worked so far, you should replace the touch screen. Replacing the touch screen is recommended in case of hardware and severe software issues. However, it can be quite an expensive fix as new touch screens aren't cheap. The prices for new touchscreens differ depending on the model. These prices start from $20 and go up to hundreds of dollars.

- ****Delete Unnecessary Apps:****If you have too many apps on your Honor Magic5 Ultimate devices, it can cause screen unresponsiveness issues. Thus, you should only install the apps you need and delete the apps that are no longer needed.
