## How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Honor 100

With the increase in our reliance on smartphones, having **touchscreen problems** on your device can be annoying. Sometimes, it’s even more frustrating than a physically broken screen because you don’t know where the issue is coming from.

If your **touchscreen is malfunctioning** or doesn’t work correctly, you cannot interact with your device. On this page, you’ll learn general **phone touch problems** on Android and how to get rid of them. Now explore the article to learn more.

![android screen problems intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems

Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.

- The **touchscreen problem**freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.
- Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.
- Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).
- The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.
- It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.
- The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.
- Outdated devices are prone to the black/white/blue screen of death.

## Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Honor 100 Touch Problems

If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your **touch screen malfunctioning,** here are some solutions to fix it.

### Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case

Some phone cases and screen protectors cause **touch problems** on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.

![android remove screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg)

### Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone

A **touchscreen malfunctioning** can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.

![android dirty screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

**Touch problems** also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.

### Method 4: Restart Your Android

Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a **touchscreen problem** on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.

![android restart method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg)

To restart your Android, press and hold the **Power** button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Down** button at the same time.

### Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android

Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to **Settings > Backup and Reset.** Next, tap on **Factory data reset** \> **Delete all**.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg)

Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.

### Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode

If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.

**Note**

Placing your Android into **Recovery Mode** is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Honor 100.

**Step 1A**: Press and hold the **Power** button and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.

**Step 1B**: If your Honor 100 still has a **Home** button, press and hold the **Home** button and the **Power** button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.

**Step 1C**: If step 1A did not put your Android into **Recovery Mode**, press and hold the **Power** and **Volume Up** and **Down** buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.

![android recovery mode 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg)

**Step 2**: Use the **Volume** buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data/factory reset, and confirm your choice with the **Power** button.

![android recovery mode 02](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg)

**Step 3**: Wait for the process to complete and for your Honor 100 to restart automatically.

### Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen

If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the **touchscreen problem,** it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Honor 100 checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.

![图像](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg)"

### Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center

Your **phone touch problem** might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

## Super Easy Ways To Deal with Honor 100 Unresponsive Screen

The evolution of smartphones signifies the development of mobile communication technology. Different from the initial years, they are not just used for messaging and calling but have many other applications. Honor 100 cell phones are presently utilized for perusing the Internet and exploring through maps, photography, videography, and numerous other used cases. A development in arranged availability goes hand-in-hand with the development of cell phones.

Honor 100 smartphones are gaining popularity owing to their low costs, high quality, and innovative features. High-resolution cameras, extensive battery life, and lightning-fast processing are just a few of the advantages of these mobile devices. Nevertheless, customers may sometimes need help with issues, such as a non-functioning Honor 100 touchscreen, which may be challenging.

Some common issues might arise for Honor 100 phone users. The Redmi note 4 touch not working is a serious problem. It can only go up to the initialization screen. In this guide, you'll find the information you need to troubleshoot and fix the most common problems reported by Motorola customers.


## **What causes a Honor 100 Screen to be unresponsive?**

The screen on your Honor 100 phone could stop responding for several reasons. The touchscreen, the system software, or the hardware itself might all be at fault. To effectively address an issue, it is crucial to locate its origins.

The following are some potential reasons for an unresponsive screen on a Honor 100 device, along with descriptions of each.

### **There are signs of soft bricking**

A touch screen not working on Honor 100 smartphones indicates a soft brick (recoverable by firmware update), often caused by a defective or undercharged battery. System file corruption, old firmware, or failed upgrades are all possible causes. Several customers have complained that after installing a software update, their Honor 100 4 or 5 device's screen became unresponsive and remained at the boot logo.

### **There might be issues with the Honor 100 device itself**

Screens on Honor 100 devices may become unresponsive for a variety of hardware-related reasons. A broken LCD panel, faulty touch sensor, or loosened ribbon wires are all possible causes. Every Honor 100 device, including the Note 4 and 5, is susceptible to these problems.

### **There might be errors in the updated software**

The Android operating system is adjustable. Some of our technological advancements may backfire on us. The phone won't power on or become stuck in a boot loop where the logo will only show intermittently. For example, some Honor 100 4 and 5 users have reported their screens are unresponsive after a software update, rendering the Honor 100 device unusable.

## **The common solutions to solve a Honor 100 Screen unresponsive**

Could anything be more annoying than a broken touchscreen on your Honor 100 phone? If this happens, the gadget is useless, and you won't be able to do even the simplest tasks. Even so, it's common for the screen to cease responding to touches.

Before taking the item in for repairs, see if you can figure out the problem independently. Do you want to learn the method? If the touch screens on your Honor 100 stop working, don’t panic; we'll teach you exactly what to do.

### **Solution 1: Try to restart your device**

![restart your phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Giving your Honor 100 a restart is one of the most common solutions if you encounter an unresponsive screen on your phone. Here’s how.

**Step 1:** Press and hold the **power button** until the screen becomes black;

**Step 2:** After 1 minute or so, hold the **power button** again to power on the Honor 100 device.

### **Solution 2: Check your charging port and battery**

![xiaomi battery and charger](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/charge-your-phone.jpg)

If the battery of your Honor 100 is empty, your screen is expected to be unresponsive. To fix that, here are some easy steps for you:

1. Charge your phone.
2. Leave it for about an hour.
3. Come back to check. Turn your phone on.
4. Test if the touchscreen is now working.

### **Solution 3: Contact Customer Service**

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

Let's assume you've applied every possible course of action. For example, your Honor 100 4 touchscreen is still unresponsive. You may contact the brand's customer support department if you need assistance. When the time comes, they'll always know what to do.

Based on the customer’s feedback, one of the frequent issues of the Honor 100 is when the screen becomes unresponsive. These issues should not usually happen, but if you find yourself in this dilemma, a list of other solutions below will help you.

### **Solution 4: Turning on your full screen option offered by MI**

![full screen options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-full-screen-gestures-menu.jpg)

Steps to activate full screen gestures

**Step 1:** Browse you setting

**Step 2:** Search for full screen display

**Step 3:** From here, tap the **screenshot** on the right with the toggle labeled **Full screen gestures**

This may include gestures to get used to but it will also fix when your touchscreen sometimes stops responding.

### **Solution 5: Backup and Factory Reset is always a choice**

![factory reset on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/android-factory-reset-fix.jpg)

Doing a factory reset may be your last remaining choice if the preceding solutions are unsuccessful. If you do this, all of the information on your phone will be deleted.

**Easy Steps in Doing a Factory Reset**

1. Press the **power button** until the phone shuts down
2. When your phone shuts down, press and hold the **power button**and **Volume down button** at the same time until the Android logo displays on the screen.
3. **Recovery Menu**will appear in your screen, press v**olume down button** until **Factory reset** is highlighted
4. Press the**power button** in selecting the Factory reset option and your phone should restart automatically.

### **Solution 6: Using Dr. Fone Android Repair Toolkit**

### **How to avoid a Honor 100 screen unresponsive?**

Users may take several precautions to avoid the Honor 100 screen unresponsive problem. Stop using any app stores or other unofficial app providers. There is a risk that doing so may damage your device or introduce viruses that will force your phone to restart. There's also a risk of losing important information like photos and files.

Regularly updating the Honor 100 phone's software is necessary to keep it running smoothly and free of issues. Tools like Dr. Fone allow users to periodically maintain and restore data by cleaning the cache and deleting unused applications.

Avoiding severe temperatures and humidity may protect the Honor 100 device's internal components and keep the screen responsive. Using high-quality charging cords is also recommended. For once, consumers won't have to worry about breaking the screen because they accidentally dropped their cell phones. If users follow these measures, they may reduce the likelihood that their Honor 100 smartphone will have an unresponsive screen.
