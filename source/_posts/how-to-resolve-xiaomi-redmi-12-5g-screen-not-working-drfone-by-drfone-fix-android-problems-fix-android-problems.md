**Step 5: Repair Android**

Now, you just have to sit back and relax. The program will begin to repair your device. Wait until you get the notification for completion.

## Cause 2: Cache conflict

The purpose of Cache in a device is to keep the track of frequently used data and information of an application. And when there are the files or data that are corrupted in the cache, this might raise the “Unfortunately WhatsApp has stopped” error. Therefore, you need to clear the WhatsApp data if the above method went futile. Here are the steps.

- Open “Settings” and go to “App Manager” or “Apps & Notifications” or “Applications”.
- Now, from the list of all applications, choose “WhatsApp”.
- Click on “Storage” and tap “Clear Data”.

## Cause 3: WhatsApp components corruption

A lot of times, the WhatsApp crashes due to the corrupted components of WhatsApp. In such case, all you need to do is uninstall and install the WhatsApp again. This is how you do it.

- Uninstall the app right away from your Homescreen or from the “Settings” > “Applications” > “All” > “WhatsApp” > “Uninstall” (for some phones).
- Go to “Play Store” and search “WhatsApp” on the search bar.
- Tap on it and start downloading followed by installing it.

## Cause 4: Not Enough Storage on your Phone

Insufficient storage could be the other reason why for your WhatsApp has stopped. When your device starts running out of space, some apps may not be able to operate properly for their functions take up space in the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device. And probably WhatsApp is one of them. If the space is the case with you, we suggest you the following two things to go with.

- Firstly, go to Settings and check the storage. Make sure it is enough i.e. at least 100 to 200MB.
- Secondly, start eliminating the apps that are no longer needed. This will indeed create more space in your device and will let your WhatsApp wok properly.

## Cause 5: Gmail Account no longer valid or hacked

It is a well-known fact that Android device and Gmail account go hand in hand. To run the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device smoothly, it is always asked to enter your Gmail address for further configurations. And when WhatsApp stops on your device, the reason might be your Gmail account. Most probably it is not valid now or maybe hacked. If this is the case, we suggest you to log out and log in with some another Gmail account.

- Log out by opening “Settings” and tap on “Accounts”.
- Choose your Google account and tap on “REMOVE ACCOUNT”.

Now, you can login again and check if WhatsApp works or not.

## Cause 6: WhatsApp Incompatible with your Android Phone

If still nothing works and your WhatsApp keeps stopping, most likely the reason is the incompatibility of your WhatsApp with your device. In such case, the thing that comes to your rescue is mod WhatsApp version like GBWhatsApp. It is a mod app which is similar to WhatsApp but in a more modified way. With this, a user gets more functionalities and customizable settings when compared to WhatsApp.

If you’re wondering how you can find this app and install, you should keep reading.
