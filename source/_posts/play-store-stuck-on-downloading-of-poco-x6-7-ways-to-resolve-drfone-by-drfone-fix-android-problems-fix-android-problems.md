This can happen to various models, such as the Poco X6, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Poco X6 device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Poco X6 device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.
