## Reliable User Guide to Fix Vivo Y100 5G Running Slow and Freezing

Android smartphones have opened a lot of doors for their users. They continue to evolve year after year with the hope of giving the world a wonderful digital experience. So far, we can all agree that they’re going the extra mile and doing a really great job. Android phones today are all packed with supreme capabilities that are beneficial to everyone.

However, Android phones are still not close to perfect. They also act up sometimes and cause a stir. Some users have observed that the **Android phone is running slow and freezing** over time. There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Vivo Y100 5G device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Vivo Y100 5G device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Vivo Y100 5G device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Vivo Y100 5G contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Vivo Y100 5G device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Vivo Y100 5G device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Vivo Y100 5G is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Vivo Y100 5G is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Vivo Y100 5Gs.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Vivo Y100 5G is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Vivo Y100 5G device. So if your Vivo Y100 5G is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Vivo Y100 5G device’s animation type and speed on your Vivo Y100 5G via the developer’s option. However, altering its default settings can sometimes make the Android phone run slow. If the speed is set slower, more delays are added to the animation. Hence, it takes a while for Your Vivo Y100 5G to launch an app or complete a certain process.

### You’re Using an Outdated Android Version

If your Vivo Y100 5G is running slow and freezing, the Vivo Y100 5G device’s software is probably outdated. The mobile apps installed on your device are lagging or crashing because they’re no longer compatible with the OS. It happens most of the time. Hence, always watch out for OS updates.

### Your Phone is Experiencing Some System Issues

Operating systems and device software serve as the main component of all smartphones. Sometimes, it runs into inevitable problems caused by computer bugs and other glitches. When it happens, the Vivo Y100 5G device’s overall performance is affected. So that can be the reason why sometimes your Vivo Y100 5G is running slow and freezing.

### Fix 5: Uninstall the Google Play Store Updates

In certain cases, issues with the [<u>Google Play Store</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-stopped/google-play-services-wont-update.html) itself may be contributing to compatibility errors. Uninstalling recent updates can revert the app to its default state. It can potentially resolve the problem. Follow these steps to uninstall updates for the Google Play Store and resolve “**device not compatible Play Store”** issues:

- **Step 1.** Using your Vivo Y100 5G's Settings, access the Google Play Store app in the "Apps" tab. Once on its info page, tap the three dots icon from the top right corner.

![navigate app settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/fixes-for-google-play-device-isnt-compatible-with-version-8.jpg)

- **Step 2.** From the available options, choose "Uninstall updates." Then confirm your decision when prompted to delete the Google Play Store updates.

### Fix 6: Sideload the Incompatible Android App

If all else fails and the compatibility issue persists, sideloading the app can be a workaround. It means installing the app manually without using the Google Play Store. This approach proves especially valuable for users with a strong determination to access a specific application. Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial on how to sideload an app:

- **Step 1.** Long-press the Google Chrome icon to open the app info menu. Navigate to the "Install unknown apps" section. Here, toggle the switch to enable "Allow from this source."

![allow apps to download via chrome](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/fixes-for-google-play-device-isnt-compatible-with-version-10.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Afterward, access a reliable, trusted website where the APK for the targeted app is available. Download and install the app to resolve the compatibility issues.

### Fix 7: Install a Custom ROM

Have you exhausted other options and are still grappling with compatibility issues? Installing a custom ROM could be a more advanced but effective solution. Custom ROMs are modified versions of Android operating systems developed by the Android community. Engaging in this procedure entails large modifications to your device's software. It is crucial to comprehend the potential consequences and proceed with caution.

Installing a custom ROM may void your device's warranty. Moreover, it's crucial to choose a ROM compatible with your device model. Installing a custom ROM is an advanced solution that should be approached with caution. It has the capability to address compatibility issues. Nevertheless, it demands a certain level of technical expertise and may not be suitable for all users.

### Fix 8: Try Using a Third-Party App Store

The final solution to avoid compatibility issues on the Google Play Store is to use a different app store. Exploring alternative app stores can be a pragmatic workaround. Several third-party app stores offer a diverse range of applications. They might provide the desired app without encountering compatibility errors and help avoid the "**device not compatible Google Play”** error.

You can explore reputable third-party app stores such as Aptoide, Amazon Appstore, GetJar, or SlideME. Ensure the chosen app store is reputable and widely used, minimizing potential security risks. Exercise caution and ensure the legitimacy of the app store to avoid security risks.
