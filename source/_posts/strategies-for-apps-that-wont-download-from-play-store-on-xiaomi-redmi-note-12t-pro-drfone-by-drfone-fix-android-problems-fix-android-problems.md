It is an essential step when trying to fix the "**Cellular Network Not Available**" error. This basic check ensures your phone is close enough to a working network tower, which matters for staying connected. It allows you to find out the availability of nearby cellular networks.

Moreover, with it, you can ensure your device is connected to a reliable network. This preliminary check sets the foundation for further troubleshooting.
