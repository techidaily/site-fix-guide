In such situations when you install an App and choose to save it to your SD Card, you will see Android App not installed error because the App cannot find the SD card as it is not mounted in your device.

4\. Storage location

You must be aware that certain Apps work their best when stored in the Oppo A79 5G device’s internal memory, whereas others need to be located on an SD Card. If you do not save the App in an appropriate location, you will find that the App isn't installed because of an unknown Error Code.

5\. Corrupt storage

Corrupted storage, especially a corrupted SD Card, is known to cause the Android App isn't installed error. Even the internal storage can get clogged due to unnecessary and unwanted data, some of which might contain an element that disturbs the storage location. Take this issue seriously as a corrupted SD Card and even clogged up internal memory can put your device in danger.

6\. Application Permission

Software operations running in the background and App Permission are not new concepts. Such errors can also cause the Unknown Error Code during App installation.

7\. Incorrect file

If you already have an App installed but download another variant of it having a distinct signed or unsigned certificate can also make the Android App not installed error pop-up. This sounds technical, but this and all the other reasons listed above can be tackled by you.

The Unknown Error Code during Application installation can occur due to any one or more of the reasons stated above. So read them carefully and understand them well to avoid such glitches in the future.

## Part 3: How to fix App not installed error on Android

We understand that it can be a tricky situation to be in when Android App not installed error pops up, but what if we tell you can get rid of it in easy and simple steps? Yes, there is!

### #1. Delete unnecessary files/Apps

Insufficient storage can prevent the app from being installed. Make some storage space on your device by cleaning unwanted data and deleting extra media and other files. You can also get rid of heavy Apps by:

Visiting “Settings” on your device. Then select "Manage apps", "Application Manager" or "Apps" (varies based on device model or version) from the list of options before you.

![application manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994440695192.jpg "application manager")

Now select the App you wish to uninstall and wait for the App Info screen to open, then click on “Uninstall” as shown in the screenshot.

![uninstall app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994441067237.jpg "uninstall app")

You can also uninstall the unnecessary application on the home screen, just long-press the app you want to uninstall until you see the "uninstall" icon. Click "Uninstall", then, you need to click "OK" to confirm the uninstall process.

![uninstall app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/android-app-not-installed-1.jpg "uninstall app")

### #2. Use only Google Play Store

As you are all aware, the Play Store is specially designed for Android software and contains only trusted and safe Apps. It is often known as the “Android Market” because it is loaded with different types of Apps to stiffly all your needs so that you don't have to rely on other third-party sources to purchase/install Apps.

![play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994442154924.jpg "play store")

### #3. Mount your SD Card

Another remedy for Android App not installed error is to make sure that the SD card inserted in your device is not inaccessible.

![mount sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/android-app-not-installed.jpg "mount sd card")

To check the same:

First, disconnect your Oppo A79 5G from your PC and then visit “Settings” on your Android and select “Storage” from the options that appear. Finally, click on “Mount SD Card” at the Storage Info screen.

You can now restart your device and try to install the app now, it should work!

### #4. Choose App location wisely

It is advisable to not tamper with the App’s location and let the software decide where it needs to be placed. As far as possible, let the Apps be in your device’s internal memory.

### #5. Format SD Card

The chances of your SD Card being corrupted are very high. You can format it either while it is in your device or externally.

Now to Clean up your SD Card, simply visit “Settings” and select “Storage” and tap on “Format SD Card” and mount it once again to use it smoothly.

![format sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994442705019.jpg "format sd card")

### #6. App Permissions

You can reset App permissions to combat the Android App not installed error by Visiting “Settings” and then selecting “Apps”. Now access the Apps menu and hit “Reset App Preferences” or “Reset application permissions”. This will allow third-party apps to get installed on your device.

### #7. Choose the correct App file

Make sure to always download an App file only from a trusted and safe source to avoid any errors during installation.

### #8. Reboot your device

Finally, if nothing else works, restart your device to end all operations which could be causing the said error. To reboot, just press the power button till you see a pop-up. Select “Restart” and wait for your device to reboot.
