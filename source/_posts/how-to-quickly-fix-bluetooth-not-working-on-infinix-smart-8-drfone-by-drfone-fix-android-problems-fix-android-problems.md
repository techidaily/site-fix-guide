Sometimes, you may have a problem with the Infinix Smart 8 device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your Infinix Smart 8, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.
2. Turn Bluetooth on, and you’ll see all the connections your Infinix Smart 8 is paired with
3. Go through these settings and remove/delete/forget every connection on your device
4. Now when you go to connect to a device using Bluetooth, repair the Infinix Smart 8 device, enter the passcode, and use a fresh paired connection.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your Infinix Smart 8 in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode
4. Wait a minute on the Main Menu
5. Now turn on your Bluetooth and connect it to your preferred device

### 2.6 Turn on the discoverable feature

![android bluetooth problems - discoverable feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-discoverable.jpg)

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the Infinix Smart 8 device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Infinix Smart 8, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Infinix Smart 8 from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Infinix Smart 8 device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Infinix Smart 8
4. If the Infinix Smart 8 devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Infinix Smart 8

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Infinix Smart 8 devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Infinix Smart 8 to the Infinix Smart 8 device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

Smart View allows you to display your Infinix Smart 8 device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.

If you recently dropped your device in water, turn it off and leave it untouched for the next few hours.

![cleaning iphone with cloth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-04.jpg)

### 2\. Remove Extra Peripherals

Unplug any external device connected to your iPhone’s Lightning port or USB-C if your **phone screen stops working**. For Android users, meanwhile, disconnect any accessories like chargers or wireless headphones. After that, try using the touchscreen. If it works, the outcome proves that the fault appeared due to the external device.

### 3\. Force Restart Your Device

If your **phone screen is still unresponsive**,maybe it **is o**verloaded. You should force restart your Infinix Smart 8. It doesn’t delete any data. Here’s how.

**Example 1: For Infinix Smart 8 Smart Phones**

Here’s how to force restart your smartphone to fix your **phone screen that’s not responding.**

- Press and hold the **Power**and **Volume Down** buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to force a reboot.

![samsung force restart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-05.jpg)

**E****xample 2: For Infinix Smart 8 Redmi**

If your Infinix Smart 8 Redmi **phone is stuck on loading screen** or “thinking” for a long time without responding, reboot it in just two steps.

**Step 1:** Press and hold the power button on the right side of the screen, then a screen showing several options appears.

**Step 2:** Choose **Restart,** then **Accept** if a confirmation message spears. Then wait a few seconds or minutes when your device is performing the reboot.

### 4\. Update Your Software

Your smartphone may behave erratically due to software bugs. While these are out of your control, you can quickly fix **your phone not responding to touch** by simply updating your OS to the latest version. Here’s how.

- For iOS users, go to your iPhone **Settings**\> **General** > **Software Update** > **Download and Install**.
- For Android owners, go to **Settings > Software Update.** Tap the **Check for software updates**to see if a new update is available.

![ios software update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-07.jpg)

### 5\. Perform a Factory Reset

If nothing helps, your remaining option is to try completing a Factory Reset. Doing this will erase all your data, but this is arguably the quickest way to restore your **screen-frozen phone** to its factory default settings. Factory Reset is available on Android devices with almost similar steps. Here’s how.

**For Android, Infinix Smart 8 Series**

**Step 1:** Search and tap the **Settings** option, and open **General management.**

**S****tep 2:** Swipe the options, find and tap **Reset** >  **Factory data reset**, and check the information below. Then swipe and press the **Reset** button.

**Note:**

You might be asked to enter the pin of the security lock on the phone if you’ve set one.

**S****tep 3:** You may need to enter your Infinix Smart 8 account password if you have bounded an account to your phone after taping **Delete all**. Then your Infinix Smart 8 phone will reset. You’ll see its initial setup screen when it turns back on.
