## What Causes A Motorola Edge 40 Pro Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Motorola Edge 40 Pro phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Motorola Edge 40 Pro screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Motorola Edge 40 Pro Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Motorola Edge 40 Pro screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Motorola Edge 40 Pro model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Motorola Edge 40 Pro Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Motorola Edge 40 Pro Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Motorola Edge 40 Pro screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Motorola Edge 40 Pro model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Motorola Edge 40 Pro black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Motorola Edge 40 Pro's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Motorola Edge 40 Pro device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Motorola Edge 40 Prologo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Motorola Edge 40 Pro Y2 and Motorola Edge 40 Pro 5A.

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device

If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

**Step 7: Repair Device**

Now, when the firmware is downloaded, the program will itself begin to repair your device. Wait and keep the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device connected until you get the notification for process completion.

### Clear the cache data the TouchWiz

Maximum Android devices are designed to deleted cache data upon getting updated to the newest Android system. However, Motorola Edge 40 Pro stands as an exception in such case. And therefore, many times **_TouchWiz starts stopping_** right after upgrading. Thus, due to the collection of cache data, TouchWiz can display error. This calls for removing the cache from TouchWiz and run things smoothly. Here is how to do this:

- Tap on “Apps” from the Home screen firstly.
- Launch “Settings” afterwards
- Look for “Applications” and tap on it followed by “Application Manager”.
- When Application Manager gets opened, swipe towards right to get into the “All” screen.
- Now, choose “TouchWiz” and tap “Clear Cache”.
- Now, tap “Clear Data” followed by “OK”.
- Now restart your device.

Please note that this will delete all your Home screens post this method.

### Disable Motion & gesture settings

The functions regarding Motions and Gestures can be responsible for why **_TouchWiz home has stopped_** in your device. Usually the Motorola Edge 40 Pro devices running on Android version less than Marshmallow are prone to encountering this issue. Or the Motorola Edge 40 Pro devices having modest specs often fall prey to the issue. When you disable these settings, you might get out of the problem.

### Change the Animation Scale

When you use TouchWiz, it may consume higher memory usage for high amount of graphic maintenance. As a result, the “**_unfortunately TouchWiz home has stopped_**” error might crop up. Taking this into consideration, you should try reconfiguring the animation scale and get rid of the error. Here’s how:

### Clear Cache Partition

In case the above steps didn’t figure out the problem, here is the next tip. This method can be counted as one of the most effective one. Because it is able to fix minor issues in Android devices, we recommend you for “**_TouchWiz home has stopped_**” issue too. Let us know how you can do it:

- Turn off your Motorola Edge 40 Pro device.
- Start pressing and holding “Volume Up” and “Power” buttons simultaneously.
- Keep doing this until you see the Android screen. This will take your device into recovery mode.
- You will observe some options on the screen. Take help of Volume buttons, scroll down to choose “Wipe Cache Partition”. Press Power button to confirm and the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device will be rebooted.

![clear cache partition](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/clear-cache-partition.jpg)

Check now if the error is eliminated. If unfortunately not, please try the following solution.

### Enable the easy mode

For some users, enabling Easy Mode has been of great assistance. This feature aims to make the user experience more efficient by simply eliminating complex features. The Easy Mode removes those features that confuse the users by messing up the screen. Hence, we suggest you to switch to this mode in order to remove “**_TouchWiz not working_**” problem. The steps are:

- Open “Settings” and go to “Personalization”.
- Hit on “Easy Mode” now.

![easy mode to fix TouchWiz stopping](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/easy-mode.jpg)

Hope the **_TouchWiz won’t keep stopping_** error does not pop up anymore!

### Boot your phone to safe mode

Here is the next solution to be followed when TouchWiz keeps stopping. As we already said, third-party apps can cause this issue, booting your device in the Safe mode will disable those apps temporarily. Hence you need to boot your Motorola Edge 40 Pro device to Safe mode and check if the reason is any third-party app.

- Switch off your device to initiate.
- Press “Power” button and keep doing this until device’s logo appears on the screen.
- When you see logo appearing, instantly release the button and start holding “Volume Down” button.
- Keep holding until rebooting finishes.
- You will now witness “Safe mode” on the bottom screen. You can now release the button.

![safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/enable-safe-mode.jpg)

### Reset Factory settings

If the above method went futile and you’re still at the same place, then factory reset is the next logical step to be taken. We suggest this method because it will take your device to its factory state. As a result, TouchWiz will probably get normal and work perfectly.

Along with this, we would also suggest you go take backup of your data so that you won’t lose any of the personal information from your device after performing factory reset. For your convenience, we have stated the backup steps too in the following guide. Have a look:

- Run “Settings’ in your device and go to “Backup & Reset”.
- Notice if “Back up my data” is enabled or not. If not, turn it on and create backup.
- Now, scroll for “Factory Data reset” option and confirm it by clicking “Reset Phone”.

![reset factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/02/reset-factory-settings.jpg)

- Wait a few minutes and your device will reboot.

### Install a new launcher to replace TouchWiz

We believe that you will find the above methods helpful. However, if still in case your **_TouchWiz is not working_**, we advice you that you should install a new theme launcher in your device. It will be a wise option to ditch TouchWiz in such scenario rather than tolerating the problem. Hope this advice will help you.
