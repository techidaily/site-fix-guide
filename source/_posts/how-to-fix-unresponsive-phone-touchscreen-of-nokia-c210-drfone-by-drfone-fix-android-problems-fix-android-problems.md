![Wifi Authentication Error fixing process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-8.png)

### Use static IP address instead of DHCP

DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is the default IP address assignment for the Wi-Fi settings on many devices. Whereas DHCP can cause IP address conflict during the dynamic IP address assignment. So, you'd better change "DHCP" to "Static" to see if the authentication error persists.

Step 1: Head to the “Settings” of your Nokia C210 and then opt for “Wireless and Networks” followed by “WLAN/WiFi”.

Step 2: Now, hit on the WiFi network that is showing "authentication error occurred".

Step 3: Depending on your Nokia C210 model, look for “IP Settings” and tap on it. Now, switch the “DHCP” to “Static”.

Step 4: Note down the static IP address fields and wipe off all the fields. Punch it in again and then save it.

### Check carefully for duplicate Wi-Fi names before you connect

Perhaps, you might connect to a WiFi with a similar name. There are good chances that some users do not modify their WiFi network name and possibly, your neighbor may have the same WiFi network, service provider. Therefore, ensure you connect to the correct WiFi network.

### Reset the Wifi network

One of the easiest ways to fix the authentication problem of Wifi is to reset the network. To do this, you would be required to forget the respective network first and then connect to it again. This can be done by simply following these steps.

1\. Firstly, you need to forget a Wifi network. To do it, go to your phone’s Settings > WiFi and network. From here, you can see a list of all the Wifi hotspots that your phone connects to. Select the network you wish to forget.

![Select the network](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981516957952.jpg)

2\. When you would select a network, it will provide the basic information related to it. Just tap on the “Forget” button and agree to the pop-up message. This will erase the network’s information from your device.

![tap on the “Forget”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981517891308.jpg)

3\. Afterward, turn on your Wifi again and tap to the network you wish to connect to. Simply provide the credentials and tap on the “Connect” button to reestablish the connection. This way, you can reset the network successfully.

![tap on the Connect button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981518275903.jpg)

### Modify network connection

If the above solution won’t work, then you would be required to walk the extra mile to fix the Nokia C210 Wifi problem. After you reset a network connection, if still getting issues regarding the authentication of the network, you need to modify the connection. In this technique, you will be changing the IP settings on your phone to alter the way it establishes a secure connection. You can do it by following these steps.

1\. To start with, visit your phone’s Settings and open the Wifi page.

![open the Wifi page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981518727215.jpg)

2\. This will display a list of all the Wifi networks that are associated with your device. Just long-tap on the Wifi network that you wish to modify. It will open another pop-up window. From here, tap on the option of “Manage network settings”. Sometimes, users also get an option of “Modify network settings” here as well. Simply select it to proceed.

![Modify network settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981519057338.jpg)

3\. It will display basic information related to your Wifi network. Just tap on the “Show advanced options” button to access more options related to the network setting.

![Show advanced options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981519311624.jpg)

4\. From the IP Settings menu, change the field from DHCP to Static. This will let you establish a static connection between your device and the router.

![change the field](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981520827015.jpg)

5\. As soon as you will change it to static, you will get different fields related to your network’s IP address, gateway, DNS, and more. Simply fill these fields and tap on the “Save” button once you are done.

![fill these fields](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521159129.jpg)

Now, try to connect to the Wifi hotspot again. You would be able to overcome the authentication problem of Wifi.

### Change Network Security Type

It has been observed that, when we connect to Wifi, our device chooses a wrong security type. This clashes with the default security protocol of the router and authentication error occurred due to this. If your device is facing the same issue, then it can be fixed by simply changing its security type. To do this, follow these instructions:

1\. To change the security type of a network, you need to “Add the network”. If you already have the Wifi network saved, then simply forget the network by following the above-mentioned tutorial.

2\. Now, turn on your device’s Wifi and tap on the option of “Add network”. Here, you would be asked to give a network name and select the security type. To manually select it, tap on the “Security” option.

![tap on the “Security”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981521984185.jpg)

3\. From here, you will get a list of various security protocols that you can pick. Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK” and save your selection.

![Select “WPA/WPA2-PSK”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981522445076.jpg)

Now, try to connect to the network again. Most likely, it will let you fix the authentication error on your device.

### Update Android firmware to the latest

There are instances where an outdated OS version of your Nokia C210 may create a hindrance in establishing a connection between your device and the WiFi network. You need to update your Android firmware to the latest version and then check if the problem persists or not.

Step 1: Launch “Settings” of your Nokia C210 and then get into the “About Phone” option.

Step 2: Now, opt for the “System Update” option. If the update is available, get your device updated to the latest OS version.

### Restart the router and reset Android network settings

Sometimes, the WiFi router may hang up while establishing a connection and therefore, the wifi authentication problem occurs. Try restarting your Wi-Fi router and then check if your device connects successfully. If this doesn’t work, try to [reset your Android Network Settings](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html#reset).

### Bonus tip: Turn Airplane mode on/off

By simply turning on the Airplane mode (and later turning it off), you can easily fix the authentication problem Wifi most of the time. You can find a toggle button for Airplane mode on the notification bar of your phone. If you can’t find it there, then go to your phone’s Settings > Connection > More Networks and turn on the feature of “Airplane Mode”.

![go to Connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14981523333039.jpg)

Let it do for a while. Afterward, turn it off and try to connect to the Wifi network again.

After following these quick and easy suggestions, you would be able to fix the Nokia C210 Wifi problem for sure. Even if you use any other Android device, then its authentication error can easily be resolved after these effective solutions.
