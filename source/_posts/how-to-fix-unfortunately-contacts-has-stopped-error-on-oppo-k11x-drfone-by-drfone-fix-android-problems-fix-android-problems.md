![android dirty screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

## Part 5: Wipe cache partition to restore Settings

Like RAM, wiping cache is also vital so as to make the Oppo K11x device’s operation smoother. And when you are getting the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error, it might be due to the collected cache. To remove it, you will need to enter the recovery mode. And the steps for recovery mode range from device to device. For instance, [Oppo K11x users](https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-recovery-mode.html) have to press the “Home”, “Power” and “Volume Up” buttons. Similarly, [HTC](https://drfone.wondershare.com/htc/htc-recovery-mode.html) and LG device users are supposed to press the “Volume Down” and “Power” buttons. For Nexus, it is “Volume Up, Down” and Power key combinations. Therefore, before going further, make sure what device you own and enter the recovery mode according to it. Now, follow the detailed guide below to wipe the cache partition in order to fix crashing Settings.

1. Primarily, turn off the Oppo K11x device and enter the recovery mode by pressing the respective key combinations.
2. You will notice a Recovery screen on your device.
3. On showing up the recovery screen, look for the “Wipe Cache partition” option and use the “Volume Down” and “Volume Up” buttons to scroll down and up respectively.
4. On reaching the required option, press the “Power” button to start wiping.
5. Once finished, click the reboot option and the Oppo K11x device will be rebooted, fixing the issue hopefully.
