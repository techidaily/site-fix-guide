![Your connection is not private error on Android.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-1.jpg)

Some common factors that could trigger the **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error**:

1. **Expired or invalid SSL certificate of the website;**

Certificates are issued for a specific period, and if the website owner fails to renew it in time, your browser will detect it as not secure.

2. **There is a mismatch between the domain on the certificate and the actual domain you are trying to visit;**

This discrepancy might occur due to a misconfiguration on the website or, in some cases, due to a man-in-the-middle attack where a third party intercepts the communication between your device and the server.

3. **No HTTPS enforcement;**

Another reason for the issue is if the installed SSL certificate doesn't turn on the "force HTTPS" option. This means visitors might be using the non-secure HTTP version of the site instead of the safe URL.

So, the error serves as a warning to users, indicating that the connection may not be secure and sensitive information could be at risk.

Browsers, including those on Android devices, prioritize user safety and privacy. They will block access to potentially compromised websites to prevent data theft or unauthorized access. That's why when you get the "your connection is not private" message on Android, you can't access the website.

## Part 2: What The Error Codes in "Your Connection Is Not Private" Mean

When **"your connection is not private" on Chrome Android error** shows up, it often comes along with specific error codes that can indicate the root cause of the issue. Understanding these error codes is crucial for troubleshooting and resolving the problem effectively.

1. **ERR\_CERT\_SYMANTEC\_LEGACY: Unsupported Symantec-issued certificate**

This error code indicates that the website you are attempting to access is equipped with an unsupported Symantec-issued certificate. Symantec, a prominent Certificate Authority, had faced concerns about the security of its certificate issuance processes.

As a result, major browsers, including Google Chrome, no longer support certificates issued by Symantec. If you encounter this error, it implies that the website's SSL certificate is outdated and needs to be updated with a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.

2. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_AUTHORITY\_INVALID: Unauthenticated SSL certificate**

The presence of this error code suggests that the SSL certificate of the website cannot be authenticated by your browser. This could occur if the certificate is self-signed or issued by an unrecognized Certificate Authority.

3. **NET::ERR\_CERT\_DATE\_INVALID: Date and time mismatch**

This error code points to a discrepancy between your Vivo Y100t's date and time settings and the information on the website's SSL certificate, as they have expiration dates. If the date and time settings on your device are incorrect, it may prevent the certificate from being validated. Correcting your device's date and time settings should resolve this issue.

4. **SSL certificate error: Generic or unspecified problem**

This is a more generic error message that indicates a problem with the website's SSL certificate without specifying the exact nature of the issue. It could indicate various issues, such as an expired certificate, a misconfiguration in the certificate chain, or other SSL-related problems.

## Part 3: How To Fix Your Connection Is Not Private on Android

Encountering the **"your connection is not private" error on Android** can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, there are various methods to address and fix this issue, depending on its underlying cause.

In this section, we will explore some effective solutions to help you regain a secure and private connection.

### Method 1: Clear your cache

When you use the internet, web browsers store information about your online activities in cached data and cookies to speed things up. However, having too much of this data can cause problems instead. It might even stop your browser from connecting securely.

So, [<u>clearing your browser cache and data </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-iphone/clear-iphone-cache.html) can be a quick and simple **"your connection is not private" Android fix.** Follow the steps here:

- **Step 1:** Open and launch Chrome.
- **Step 2:** Access the Menu (the three dots button) to open the Settings. Select Privacy and Security > Clear Browsing Data.
- **Step 3:** Opt for the "All Time" option and click "Clear Data" to erase your cache.

![Clear the browser's cache and data.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-2.jpg)

After successfully clearing your browser cache and data, revisit the website to check if the problem persists.

### Method 2: Repair the Android system

Addressing the **"your connection is not private" to fix on Android** involves examining both the Vivo Y100t device and the website. If clearing browser data doesn't help, there might be an issue with your Android system. One solution is to use the [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) system repair tool to fix the issues safely.

How to perform system repair with Dr.Fone:

- **Step 1.** Open the Repair Tool

Start by launching Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer. Go to the Toolbox section and connect your Vivo Y100t. Choose System Repair and pick Android as your device type.

- **Step 2.** Begin Repair

Click Start on the new screen to kick off the repair. Since you're dealing with a connection private issue on Android, select System Damage.

![Confirm the repair process.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-7.png)

When done, click Done if your Android starts properly. If not, click Try Again to repeat the process.

### Method 3: Check and fix the date and time on your Android

Since the error code "NET::ERR\_CERT\_DATE\_INVALID" indicates a mismatch between the date and time on your device and your browser, you need to adjust the date and time settings on your Android to fix it.

The specific steps can vary based on your Android model, but the general approach involves locating the "date and time" settings on your phone. How to fix the date and time on Android to **bypass "your connection is not private" on Chrome Android**:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Vivo Y100t's Settings > Date & Time.
- **Step 2:** Switch on the "Automatic Date & Time" to sync with the network-provided time.

![Check and fix the Android's date and time.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-8.jpg)

### Method 4: Perform factory reset

If nothing else works, there might be malware on your phone causing trouble. It's crucial to eliminate this threat before further damage occurs. The recommended action is to [<u>perform a factory reset </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) on your phone.

However, keep in mind that this process can result in data loss, so it's essential to back up your data beforehand. Follow the steps to perform a factory reset on Android:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Android Settings.
- **Step 2:** Select Backup and Reset > Factory data reset. Then, opt to erase all data.

![Perform a factory reset.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/connection-private-android-9.jpg)

Most of the time, you won't need to go to the extreme of a factory reset. The simpler solutions mentioned earlier should take care of the Security Certificate Error on your Android.
