![snapchat stopping - check for android update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-update-firmware.png)

Similar to some of the other solutions we’ve listed above, if you’re using an outdated version of the Android operating system, but the latest version of Snapchat is coded to the most recent, this can be a cause for the Snapchat crashing on Android problem to occur.

**Step 1:** Open the Settings menu on your Infinix GT 10 Pro, followed by the Wi-Fi option.

![snapchat stopping - stop rom](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-custom-rom.jpg)

If you’re running a custom Android ROM on your device, with some versions of the ROM and some apps, you’re going to experience errors simply because of the way the apps and the ROMs are coded and designed.

Unfortunately, there’s no easy fix to this, and if you want to continue using the app, you’ll need to reflash your Infinix GT 10 Pro back to its original firmware, and then wait until the ROM developers update the ROM to be compatible with social apps like Snapchat.

One of the last resorts you can take is factory resetting your Infinix GT 10 Pro back to its original settings. From the day you first started using your device, you’ve been using the system and downloading files and apps, and over time this increases the chances of creating a bug.

### Cache Buildup

Accumulated cache data can hamper app performance, leading to frequent crashes. [Clear the cache](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-iphone/clear-iphone-cache.html) of the Pandora app. Usually, you can see this option under **Settings > Apps** > **Clear Data.** Additionally, you can optimize your device’s RAM and storage space by deleting unnecessary files or closing unused apps.

### Device Compatibility Issues

Outdated system software can create compatibility issues, causing app instability. Ensure your device’s system software is up-to-date. Check for and install any pending system updates in your device’s settings. Updated software often includes [bug fixes](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/fix-ios-17-keyborad-bug-and-autocorrect-issue.html) and improvements that can rectify compatibility-related crashes.

You can systematically troubleshoot and resolve the issues by addressing the potential culprits behind constant Pandora app crashes, ensuring a smoother and uninterrupted music streaming experience. If the problems persist, contacting Pandora support or seeking professional assistance might be advisable to delve deeper into the technical aspects of the app’s performance issues.

## Part 3: What To Do if None of the Fixes Work

If the suggested fixes don’t work, and you still wonder “**why does Pandora keeps stopping on Android**,” then it might be time to take a look at these alternatives:

- **Consider trying other music streaming apps.**Explore alternative music streaming applications available on the Google Play Store. Several reliable options offer similar services to Pandora, providing an opportunity to continue enjoying music while bypassing the persistent app issues.
- **Contact customer support.**Reach out to Pandora’s customer support for tailored assistance. They may offer specific troubleshooting steps or insights into the app’s technical glitches.
- **Consider a new phone.** Upgrade to a new phone if the crashes persist despite troubleshooting, and your device is outdated or incompatible. This might help resolve the issue by providing a more stable environment for app usage.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, navigating Pandora app crashes on your Infinix GT 10 Pro demands a systematic approach. Keeping regular maintenance, such as clearing cache, optimizing RAM, and ensuring timely device updates, can mitigate app crashes and uphold smooth performance. This way, you can resolve the issue of **why Pandora keeps stopping.**
