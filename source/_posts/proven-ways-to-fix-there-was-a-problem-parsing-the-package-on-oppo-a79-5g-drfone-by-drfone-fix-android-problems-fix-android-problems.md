****Step 6:**** Your device will need to have the new Android firmware flashed onto it, which Wondershare Dr.Fone will take care of. Simply wait while the process completes.

## Part 3: Benefits of Using Dr.Fone on Phones With Dead Oppo A79 5Gs

If your phone's screen is malfunctioning or some features are inaccessible due to stuck or dead pixels, following the steps to ****fix dead pixels on the phone**** may be challenging. Resetting your phone and backing up data can also be a hassle.

The good thing is Dr.Fone can help you with these issues, making the process easier and more efficient. This app offers a variety of benefits and features that can help you find a quick and effective fix for your smartphone.

- ****Backup and recovery of data****. Dr.Fone offers a straightforward way to back up your vital data from iOS and Android smartphones and selectively restore specific files when needed. This feature is essential for those who have lost important files due to a phone's damage, malfunction, or accidental deletion. It allows you to recover data and avoid potential data loss.

- ****Ease of use****. The software is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it accessible to anyone without advanced technical knowledge.
- ****Safety****. The software is safe and secure, ensuring that your data is not compromised during the process. This feature is for users concerned about the confidentiality of their data and wants to ensure that their personal information is not shared or stored on the internet.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Oppo A79 5Gs Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Oppo A79 5Gs Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Oppo A79 5Gs Spreading on My Oppo A79 5G?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Oppo A79 5Gs Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Oppo A79 5G devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.

## Conclusion

You have learned the difference between a stuck and ****dead pixel on the phone****. With this knowledge, you can apply the different tools and techniques for removing ****stuck pixels on phone**** screens and how to work around dead pixels on the phone screen. Whether using software like Dr.Fone or employing manual methods such as rebooting or cleaning your device, there are various options you can try.

Remember to back up your data before attempting any fixes and to seek professional help if necessary. If you are still experiencing issues with dead pixels on your phone screen, don't hesitate to contact your device manufacturer for further assistance.
