No worries, though. We've got you covered with a simple guide in this article. Just follow the steps, and you'll get those **missing app icons** back on your Honor Magic 5 Pro.


## Part 1: Make Sure if the Missing App Is Installed

Before proceeding with troubleshooting the **missing app icon on your Android** device, it's essential to confirm whether the app is still installed or if it has been accidentally deleted. To do it, you can have a quick check on Google Play:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Play Store.
- **Step 2:** Tap your Google profile at the top right and find Manage apps and devices.
- **Step 3:** Open Manage and select the “Installed” tab.

Now, see whether you can find the **app icon that disappeared on your Android.** If you can’t find it, it means the app has been accidentally deleted, and you can install it back on your device. However, if it’s confirmed to be installed on your Android but remains missing from your home screen, you can continue the following practice.

## Part 2: How To Find the Missing App Icon on Android

_“_**_All my apps disappeared from my home Android screen._** _What should I do?”_

If you've confirmed that the missing app is installed, but its icon is nowhere to be found on your home screen, don't fret—there are several solutions you can take to locate and restore the **missing app icon on Android**.

### 1\. Check hidden apps

How could the **Android phone icon be missing**? Well, app icons can disappear from your home screen for different reasons. One of the common reasons is you might have accidentally hidden it in your phone. To find and check whether the app is hidden, the steps can be different depending on the phone model you are using.

However, as a general guide, you can follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Go to your phone’s Settings.
- **Step 2.** Use the search bar to look for "Hidden app."

### 2\. Move the app to the home screen from the App Drawer

If your **app icon disappeared on your Android**, you can also easily restore it by adding the app to the home screen from the app drawer. Follow the step-by-step guide below:

### 3\. Re-enable disabled app

**App icons can also disappear on the Android** home screen if you unintentionally or intentionally disable them. Certain phone models even offer a functionality known as 'Freezer,' allowing users to temporarily halt the apps. While in a frozen state, the app remains inactive and doesn't appear on the home screen until you unfrozen it.

To re-enable the disabled app, you can follow the steps here:

- **Step 1**. Open the Apps & Notifications on the Settings.
- **Step 2.** Select the app which icon is missing on your home screen. For example, tap the phone app if the **phone icon disappears on your Android.**
- **Step 3:** In the App Info, tap Enable.

### 4\. Reset Android to factory settings

If the previous methods don't work, you might need to do a [<u>factory reset on your Honor Magic 5 Pro</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html). But before doing that, it's important to back up your data first because a factory reset will clear all your data and cache when you press the reset button.

How to reset Android to factory setting:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Android Settings.
- **Step 2:** Select Backup and Reset > Factory data reset. Then, choose to erase all data.

Please be mindful that performing a factory reset on Android will reset your Android completely to its initial state.

## Honor Magic 5 Pro Camera Not Working Unexpected Error? Fix It Now

Don’t throw the phone, not yet. Let us help you out.

![camera not working error in android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg)

## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Honor Magic 5 Pro.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Honor Magic 5 Pro. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Honor Magic 5 Pro right where you are, without needing to take the Honor Magic 5 Pro device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Honor Magic 5 Pro device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Camera.

![set camera permissions android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg)

Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

### II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)

## Part 4: Android Phone Won't Turn On: **Common Fix**

To try fixing an Android Phone that won’t turn on, follow these steps:

1. For any Android devices, remove the battery (considering the battery of your Honor Magic 5 Pro can be removed) and leave it out for at least 30 minutes. Put back the battery in and try to turn it on.
2. Press and hold down the **Power** and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time for 15-30 minutes to reboot the Honor Magic 5 Pro device.
3. Should the first two steps do not work, charge your Honor Magic 5 Pro to get it out of the start-up loop. You can also opt to use a different battery, just in case your current battery is the source of the problem.
4. If there are any connected hardware e.g. SD card, remove them from the Honor Magic 5 Pro device.
5. Start your Honor Magic 5 Pro in **Safe Mode** by pressing and holding down the **Menu** or **Volume Down** button on your device.
6. Should the first five steps do not work for you, perform a hard reset. Do take note that each device will have a different way to do so and that data that is stored locally on the phone will be deleted.
7. Send your Honor Magic 5 Pro to the repair shop should none of these steps work.
