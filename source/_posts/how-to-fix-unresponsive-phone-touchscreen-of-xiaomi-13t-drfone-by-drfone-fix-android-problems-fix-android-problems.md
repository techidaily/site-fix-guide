If you recently dropped your device in water, turn it off and leave it untouched for the next few hours.

![cleaning iphone with cloth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-04.jpg)

### 2\. Remove Extra Peripherals

Unplug any external device connected to your iPhone’s Lightning port or USB-C if your **phone screen stops working**. For Android users, meanwhile, disconnect any accessories like chargers or wireless headphones. After that, try using the touchscreen. If it works, the outcome proves that the fault appeared due to the external device.

### 3\. Force Restart Your Device

If your **phone screen is still unresponsive**,maybe it **is o**verloaded. You should force restart your Xiaomi 13T. It doesn’t delete any data. Here’s how.

**Example 1: For Xiaomi 13T Smart Phones**

Here’s how to force restart your smartphone to fix your **phone screen that’s not responding.**

- Press and hold the **Power**and **Volume Down** buttons simultaneously for more than 7 seconds to force a reboot.

![samsung force restart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-05.jpg)

**E****xample 2: For Xiaomi 13T Redmi**

If your Xiaomi 13T Redmi **phone is stuck on loading screen** or “thinking” for a long time without responding, reboot it in just two steps.

**Step 1:** Press and hold the power button on the right side of the screen, then a screen showing several options appears.

**Step 2:** Choose **Restart,** then **Accept** if a confirmation message spears. Then wait a few seconds or minutes when your device is performing the reboot.

### 4\. Update Your Software

Your smartphone may behave erratically due to software bugs. While these are out of your control, you can quickly fix **your phone not responding to touch** by simply updating your OS to the latest version. Here’s how.

- For iOS users, go to your iPhone **Settings**\> **General** > **Software Update** > **Download and Install**.
- For Android owners, go to **Settings > Software Update.** Tap the **Check for software updates**to see if a new update is available.

![ios software update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-07.jpg)

### 5\. Perform a Factory Reset

If nothing helps, your remaining option is to try completing a Factory Reset. Doing this will erase all your data, but this is arguably the quickest way to restore your **screen-frozen phone** to its factory default settings. Factory Reset is available on Android devices with almost similar steps. Here’s how.

**For Android, Xiaomi 13T Series**

**Step 1:** Search and tap the **Settings** option, and open **General management.**

**S****tep 2:** Swipe the options, find and tap **Reset** >  **Factory data reset**, and check the information below. Then swipe and press the **Reset** button.

**Note:**

You might be asked to enter the pin of the security lock on the phone if you’ve set one.

**S****tep 3:** You may need to enter your Xiaomi 13T account password if you have bounded an account to your phone after taping **Delete all**. Then your Xiaomi 13T phone will reset. You’ll see its initial setup screen when it turns back on.

Some common questions you should know when taking care of an unresponsive phone touchscreen are listed below.

### 1\. Why Did My iPhone Screen Go Black After Not Responding to Touch?

Your iPhone screen with a **touch issue** will sometimes go black after not responding to touch due to several issues. It could be hardware, software, issues with a particular app, software crash, or you have a low battery. If it’s a drained battery, you’re in luck; all you have to do is charge it.
