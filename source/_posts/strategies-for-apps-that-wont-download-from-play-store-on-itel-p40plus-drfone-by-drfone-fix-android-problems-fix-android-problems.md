## Part 5: Wipe cache partition to restore Settings

Like RAM, wiping cache is also vital so as to make the Itel P40+ device’s operation smoother. And when you are getting the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error, it might be due to the collected cache. To remove it, you will need to enter the recovery mode. And the steps for recovery mode range from device to device. For instance, [Itel P40+ users](https://drfone.wondershare.com/samsung/samsung-recovery-mode.html) have to press the “Home”, “Power” and “Volume Up” buttons. Similarly, [HTC](https://drfone.wondershare.com/htc/htc-recovery-mode.html) and LG device users are supposed to press the “Volume Down” and “Power” buttons. For Nexus, it is “Volume Up, Down” and Power key combinations. Therefore, before going further, make sure what device you own and enter the recovery mode according to it. Now, follow the detailed guide below to wipe the cache partition in order to fix crashing Settings.

1. Primarily, turn off the Itel P40+ device and enter the recovery mode by pressing the respective key combinations.
2. You will notice a Recovery screen on your device.
3. On showing up the recovery screen, look for the “Wipe Cache partition” option and use the “Volume Down” and “Volume Up” buttons to scroll down and up respectively.
4. On reaching the required option, press the “Power” button to start wiping.
5. Once finished, click the reboot option and the Itel P40+ device will be rebooted, fixing the issue hopefully.

## Part 6: Factory reset your Android

You can also opt for Factory resetting your device to fix the issue of Settings keeps stopping. By removing everything from the Itel P40+ device, it will make your device run properly. If you have important data on your device, please make sure to [create a backup](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) before taking action if you don’t want to lose it. The steps are as follows.

1. In the “Settings, go to “Backup and Reset”.
2. Tap on “Factory data reset” followed by “Reset device”.
3. Wait for the completion of the process and check if Settings is stopping or not after it gets rebooted.

## Part 7: Check and update Android OS

A lot of times minor issues crop up due to the operating systems that get outdated. It is because the Itel P40+ device needs to get updated from time-to-time for proper functioning otherwise it will not be able to match up with the fading technologies thereby coming up with issues like “Unfortunately Settings has stopped”. We recommend here you check for the available update and update your device. For this follow the guide below.

1. Go to “Settings” and tap “About Phone” on your device.
2. Now, hit on “System Update” and the Itel P40+ device will look for any available update.
3. If there is any, go along with the prompts to install it and make your phone even smarter.
