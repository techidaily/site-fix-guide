## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

Below are the common causes why a **cell phone bricks**.

#### Failed Updates

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Poco X5 Pro device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Poco X5 Pro device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

Rooting, which grants users superuser access to their device's OS, can lead to bricking if not done right. [Rooting](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-check-if-your-android-phone-is-rooted.html) often involves making deep system changes, and errors can disrupt the phone's core functionality.

#### Installing Bad Apps

Installing malicious, incompatible, or poorly coded apps can lead to a soft brick situation. In severe cases, they can trigger a [boot loop](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/boot-loop-android.html) or render the phone unresponsive.

#### Others

Several less common factors can also contribute to bricking. Overclocking, attempting to modify the bootloader, or tampering with system files can lead to disastrous consequences. Hardware issues, such as faulty memory or battery problems, might also manifest as bricked devices.

## Part 2. Unbricking Methods and Tools

Below are solutions that you can employ to fix various brick phone scenarios.

### Seek Professional Assistance (Hard Brick and Soft Brick)

## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Poco X5 Pro device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

It is also very commonly observed that the charging end of the cable which gets connected to the charging port of the Poco X5 Pro device gets damaged and prevents the current from flowing to the phone/tablet.

![charging cable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459762305.jpg)

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Poco X5 Pro device.

![check charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459938188.jpg)

The best way to take this problem is to clean the port with a blunt pin or a soft bristle unused toothbrush. Make sure you clean the port gently and do not damage it or its sensors.

![clean charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985460097930.jpg)

### 3\. Check/replace charging adapter

This method is fairly simple, and all you need to do is check whether or not the charging adapter is working properly as sometimes, the adapter itself is to be blamed for the charge. To make sure that you are not using a defective adapter, connect your charging cable/USB to another adapter. If your device charges normally, it means there is a problem is with your adapter, and you must replace it at the earliest to solve My Poco X5 Pro won't charge the issue.

![check charging adapter](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985010302112.jpg)

### 4\. Try another power source

This technique is more like a quick trick. It means to switch from one power source to another or use a more efficient and suitable power source. Laptops and PCs charge slower than a direct power source, i.e., a wall socket. Sometimes, the charging speed is slower, and the battery is draining. In such a scenario, choose to charge your device by directly plugging it into a socket on the wall to never experience My Poco X5 Pro won't charge problem.

Follow the steps given below to clear your device’s cache:
