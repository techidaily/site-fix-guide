### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

You’ve often heard that recovery mode will solve just about any problem your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G is experiencing.
