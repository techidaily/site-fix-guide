### 3.7 Uninstall incompatible apps

Android screen black can be a result of installing a bug or incompatible apps. If you have recently installed an app that crashes frequently, that may be the reason for the issue.

Step 2: Press the Power Off button to enter Safe mode.

Step 4: To return to Normal mode, turn off your device and then turn it back on.

### 3.9 Factory reset to fix Android black screen of death

The factory reset is the option that enables the factory state of your device by erasing all data, settings, bugs, and apps. Your device will be fresh like factory condition after this reset. Worth mentioning here, you’ll lose all the internal data and installed apps after this reset. So, to overcome the Android tablet black screen of death, you must perform this action as the last option. Follow the below steps carefully.

Step 1: Turn off the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device. Then press the Volume Up + Power button + home button (or press Volume Up + Power buttonS) altogether and let the mobile boot into recovery mode.

Step 2: After booting up in recovery mode, you can find the "Factory data reset" option. Navigate to that option with the volume up and down arrow and select it with the power button.

![Factory data reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/06/14987030401463.jpg)

Now, your device will reboot automatically and you can see the Android black screen of death problem is solved.
