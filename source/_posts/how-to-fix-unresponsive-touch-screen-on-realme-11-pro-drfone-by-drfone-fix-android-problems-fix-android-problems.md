## How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Realme 11 Pro

With the increase in our reliance on smartphones, having **touchscreen problems** on your device can be annoying. Sometimes, it’s even more frustrating than a physically broken screen because you don’t know where the issue is coming from.

If your **touchscreen is malfunctioning** or doesn’t work correctly, you cannot interact with your device. On this page, you’ll learn general **phone touch problems** on Android and how to get rid of them. Now explore the article to learn more.

![android screen problems intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is My Android Experiencing Touch Screen Problems

Below are some of the most common reasons you’re experiencing touch problems on your Android smartphone.

- The **touchscreen problem**freezes your phone, lags, or hangs.
- Some parts of the screen work fine, but some don’t.
- Your screen responds inaccurately (typing “a” gets you “q” or “z”).
- The touchscreen is automatically operating itself, resulting in ghost touch.
- It doesn’t respond to any taps, and the phone’s screen has stopped working.
- The device is physically damaged, or the screen is cracked or broken.
- Outdated devices are prone to the black/white/blue screen of death.

## Part 2: Tips, Fixes, and Workarounds To Fix Your Realme 11 Pro Touch Problems

If any of the outlined reasons above are the cause of your **touch screen malfunctioning,** here are some solutions to fix it.

### Method 1: Remove the Screen Protector and Phone Case

Some phone cases and screen protectors cause **touch problems** on your Android screen. This issue is prevalent if you recently changed your phone case or screen protector. It may be due to incompatibility, but you should remove them to see if your phone starts responding again.

![android remove screen protector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-02.jpg)

### Method 2: Clean Your Android Smartphone

A **touchscreen malfunctioning** can also be a sign of a dirty display. Since the screen relies on contact between your fingers and the touchpad to perform actions, this also applies to foreign particles such as dirt, debris, smudges, oil, and more. Clean your touchscreen with wipes or a soft cloth by gently wiping over the screen.

![android dirty screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Stop Using Your Android Device for a While

**Touch problems** also arise due to abnormal temperature changes. Your phone might experience ghost touch if it’s too cold or hot. For your screen to function correctly, it needs to be in a temperate environment. Remember to take breaks between phone usage, especially when the phone gets too hot. Avoid using your device under hot conditions, direct sunlight, or anything affecting your phone’s normal temperature.

### Method 4: Restart Your Android

Performing a reboot sounds trivial with such a complicated issue. But sometimes, it’s often the most successful way to fix a **touchscreen problem** on an Android device. Restarting your Android shuts down and resets all background services, which may have led to your issue.

![android restart method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-04.jpg)

To restart your Android, press and hold the **Power** button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In other smartphones, you may need to hold down the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Down** button at the same time.

### Method 5: Factory Data Reset Your Android

Before attempting to have your device checked for any hardware defects, you should try completing a Factory Reset. To do this, go to **Settings > Backup and Reset.** Next, tap on **Factory data reset** \> **Delete all**.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-05.jpg)

Performing a Factory Data Reset will erase all your data and restore your device to its factory default settings. Creating a backup before doing this step is recommended, as you will lose all your personal data once the process starts.

### Method 6: Put Your Android into Recovery Mode

If all else fails, placing your Android into Recovery Mode should be a last resort. Doing this method works similarly to the method above. You should perform this method if the screen is unresponsive and only the buttons on your Android are functional. Here’s how.

**Note**

Placing your Android into **Recovery Mode** is different depending on your Android smartphone. Refer to your owner’s manual to see which method is right for your Realme 11 Pro.

**Step 1A**: Press and hold the **Power** button and **Volume Down** buttons at the same time. Continue holding both buttons until the screen starts.

**Step 1B**: If your Realme 11 Pro still has a **Home** button, press and hold the **Home** button and the **Power** button at the same time. Continue holding them until the screen starts.

**Step 1C**: If step 1A did not put your Android into **Recovery Mode**, press and hold the **Power** and **Volume Up** and **Down** buttons simultaneously. Continue pressing all three until the screen starts.

![android recovery mode 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-06.jpg)

**Step 2**: Use the **Volume** buttons to navigate the choices, select Wipe data/factory reset, and confirm your choice with the **Power** button.

![android recovery mode 02](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-07.jpg)

**Step 3**: Wait for the process to complete and for your Realme 11 Pro to restart automatically.

### Method 7: Replace Your Android Touchscreen

If doing all the earlier workarounds and fixes couldn’t resolve the **touchscreen problem,** it could be the screen itself. While replacing the touchscreen yourself is possible if you have the technical know-how, it’s still best to bring it to a professional to prevent further damage. You should have your Realme 11 Pro checked by a technician if the screen is getting weak, has water damage, or has failing screen components.

![图像](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/general-android-touchscreen-problems-and-methods-of-resolving-them-08.jpg)"

### Method 8: Bring it to an Authorized Service Center

Your **phone touch problem** might not be caused by the screen, even when you had it replaced. If your Android is still unresponsive, it’s best to bring your smartphone to an authorized service center or directly to the phone manufacturer, especially when all efforts are exhausted.

After the Realme 11 Pro device powers down, wait for about 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure it has fully shut down before moving forward. Subsequently, press and hold the power button until the Google logo displays to restart your device.

## Scenario 6. Software Damaged? Restore Immediately

When an Android device experiences severe software damage, it can lead to major issues like **the Realme 11 Pro 3 won't turn on**. This can hinder the functionality of the Realme 11 Pro device. It also includes the inability to turn on or persistent system malfunctions. In such cases, performing a complete phone restore becomes a necessary solution:

### Reason 1. Corrupted System Files or Firmware Issues

**Solution.** In cases of severe software damage or corruption of system files, performing a settings reset becomes imperative. It is to restore the Realme 11 Pro device to its default settings and resolve underlying issues.

### Reason 2. Factory Reset as a Solution

[Performing a factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) serves as the ultimate solution. This is true when facing critical software damage that leads to a non-responsive Realme 11 Pro 3/4. This process erases all user data, apps, settings, and files stored on the Realme 11 Pro device, reverting it to its original factory state.

#### Steps To Perform a Factory Reset on Realme 11 Pro 3/4

- **Step 1.** Access the "Settings" application on your Realme 11 Pro 3/4. Then, navigate through the menu until you locate the "System" category located further down the list. Within the "System" settings, tap the last option named "Reset Options."

## Scenario 7. Phone Hangs on Installed App

There are scenarios where a phone, like the Realme 11 Pro 3, hangs or gets stuck on a specific installed app. It happens during the startup process, and it can prevent the Realme 11 Pro device from turning on properly. This issue often arises due to a malfunctioning or poorly coded app. This app disrupts the Realme 11 Pro device's startup routine, causing **Realme 11 Pro 4 won’t turn on**.

### Reason 1. Third-Party Apps Interference

**Solution:** Start by booting the Realme 11 Pro 3 into Safe Mode. This mode disables third-party apps, allowing you to access the Realme 11 Pro device without interference from downloaded applications.

### Reason 2. Problematic App

**Solution:** While in Safe Mode, observe if the Realme 11 Pro device boots up properly. If it successfully boots, it suggests that a third-party application is causing the problem. To pinpoint the problematic app, uninstall recently added apps individually and restart the Realme 11 Pro device after each removal. This process helps pinpoint the problematic app causing the hang during startup.

### Reason 3. Stacked Up App Cache and Data

**Solution:** If the problematic app is identified, try clearing its cache and data. Go to Settings and then access "Apps." Within "Apps," find the Problematic App and tap "Storage & cache." On the subsequent display, select "[Clear cache](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-android/clear-cache-android.html)" and "Clear storage" to restore the application to its original settings. After restarting the Realme 11 Pro device, verify whether the problem persists.

![clear storage and cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/google-pixel-3-wont-turn-on-19.jpg)

### Reason 4. Outdated Application

**Solution:** If the application is essential, ensure to seek updates within the Google Play Store. Updating the app to its latest version could potentially resolve any compatibility issues. Alternatively, if updates are not available or don’t resolve the problem, consider uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
