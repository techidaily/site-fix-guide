### Fix 3: Free Up Space to Make Sure Android Have Enough Internal Memory

In case the Android internal memory is completely filled, it will slow down the processing speed of the Motorola G24 Power device.

You can follow these steps to free up some space on your Motorola G24 Power:

**Step 1:** Open the Settings app on your Motorola G24 Power and access the “Battery and Device Care” option by scrolling down. Next, tap on the “Three Dots” from the top right corner and choose the “Storage Booster” feature.

### Fix 4: Enter Safe Mode to Uninstall Suspicious Apps

This issue can also occur if you have installed an app from the Google Play Store with a very low rating or an APK. Unlike Apple App Store, anyone can easily upload their mobile apps on Play Store, so it is important to check the app's credibility before installing it. Following are the simplified instructions to enter the safe mode and delete all suspicious applications:

Press and hold the “Power” button of your Android and press and hold the “Power Off” option to access the “Safe Mode” feature. Afterward, confirm to enter the safe mode and remove all the suspicious apps from the Motorola G24 Power device. You can do this by holding on to the app and selecting the “Uninstall” option from the pop-up options.

![turn on the safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/fix-process-system-not-responding-4.jpg)

### Fix 5: Update All Apps on your Device

Updating the apps is crucial for any Android device to work with high efficiency and performance. Apps are developed to make the users' daily tasks easy to execute. However, there might be some negligence in the development, which can leave some bugs in the app. These bugs are fixed with time by releasing the new version of the app. To update your Android app, proceed with the following step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1:** Locate the Play Store from the Android home screen and access it. Then, tap the “Profile” icon from the top right corner and proceed to the “Manage apps and devices” option. Afterward, you can check how many app updates are available from the “Updates available” option. To update the apps, you will have to go inside this option.

### Fix 6: Check the SD card

If you are still getting the **process system isn’t responding** to Android error, then chances are that there could be an issue with your SD card. Firstly, check if your SD card is working fine or not. If it is corrupted, then get another memory card for your phone. Also, it should have a prominent amount of free storage. You might be facing this issue if the SD card has limited free space.

Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.

After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.
