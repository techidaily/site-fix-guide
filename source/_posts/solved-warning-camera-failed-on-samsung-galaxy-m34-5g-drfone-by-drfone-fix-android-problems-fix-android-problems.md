## Part 3. How to Prevent Bricking Your Phone

How to prevent a device from “bricking” itself and how to repair it if it does The delay is set by the MCU, but it should be long enough to allow the debug adapter to connect to the Samsung Galaxy M34 5G device and halt it before the Samsung Galaxy M34 5G device disables itself.

Here are some things to remember to prevent your device from bricking:

- **Avoiding unofficial firmware updates:** Installing unapproved OS firmware on your phone will most certainly violate any manufacturer's warranty you have on it. Read the installation instructions for your unique phone model thoroughly and then carefully follow them, taking time and patience.
- **Being cautious when rooting or jail breaking:**Rooting and Jail breaking disables parts of the operating system's built-in security mechanisms, which are part of what makes the operating system safe, and your data protected from exposure or damage.
- **Install an antivirus application on your device:**Mobile devices increase the danger of data leaks and breaches. As a result, antiviral software is beneficial on mobile phones. Mobile Device Management is an excellent choice for virus protection on your mobile device.
- **Backup your phone data regularly:** Backing up your phone safeguards your data in the event that you lose it, it is stolen, or it no longer works. When it comes time to replace your phone, having a backup makes it simple to restore your data to the new device. Furthermore, backing up your phone allows you to organize your data so that it is easier to access.
- **Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:** Apps installed from unauthorized sources make your device and personal data more exposed to dangers such as Ransomware. So you should be wary of where you download applications.

## Conclusion

It is certainly upsetting when your gadget bricks, but you may attempt the solutions listed above to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, if you want to solve the problem quickly and easily, you can try Wondershare Dr.Fone. It can not only help you repair your Android smartphone, but it can also help you extract data from a bricked device, recover data, and many more Android device solutions!
