### Method 4: Perform a Factory Reset

If all the methods above did not solve your problem, the last resort you can take is to perform a Factory Reset. This method works on Android and iOS smartphones and erases all your data. It is the quickest way to try to fix why your **phone screen went black**. Here are the steps.

**For Android Users**

If you’re on Android, tap **Settings > Backup and Reset. T**ap on **Factory data reset** \> **Delete all** to initiate the factory reset.

If you cannot do this, here’s how to perform a factory reset manually using Recovery Mode.

**Note**

**Step 1A**: Press and hold the **Power** button and **Volume Down** buttons simultaneously and continue holding until the screen starts.

**Step 1B**: For Android devices with a **Home** button, press and hold the **Home** button and the **Power** button and continue holding until the screen starts.

**Step 1C**: Press and hold the **Power** button as well as the **Volume Up** and **Volume Down** buttons simultaneously and continue holding until the screen starts.

**Step 2:** Next, choose **Erase All Content and Settings**. Check the list of items you want to remove.

![ios erase all content and settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/how-to-deal-with-the-phone-screen-black-but-still-works-08.jpg)
