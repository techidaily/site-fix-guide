## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

### 3\. Network Congestion

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the Honor V Purse device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue. They affect the Honor V Purse device's capacity to sustain a consistent connection with the cellular network. This consequently causes voice call unavailability.

Before diving into complex fixes, the first thing to do is to check if nearby cell networks are available and how strong their signals are.

### Solution 2. Check the Airplane Mode of the Smartphone

Another crucial step in resolving this error involves ensuring that the Airplane Mode is disabled. This mode, when activated, disables all wireless connections. It also includes cellular networks, which could lead to connectivity issues. Follow these simple steps to check and disable Airplane Mode on your device:

**Instructions:** Swipe down on your phone's screen from the top to access the Notification Panel, unveiling the Quick Settings tiles.

### Solution 5. Enable Roaming Settings

There are situations where you're in an area with weak or no coverage from your primary network provider. In such a case, enabling roaming settings on your Honor V Purse can sometimes resolve the issue at hand. Enabling roaming allows your device to connect to partner networks. This extends your coverage beyond your home network's reach. Follow these steps to enable roaming settings on your Honor V Purse:

- **Step 1.** Start by accessing your device's Settings and tapping the "Connections" option. Here, scroll downward to press "Mobile Networks."
