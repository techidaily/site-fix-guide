This article aims to provide solutions for Lava Yuva 2 phone users experiencing screen unresponsiveness. We will explore various reasons this issue may occur and discuss step-by-step instructions for fixing the problem. So, if your **Lava Yuva 2 touchscreen is not working**, don't worry – we've got you covered!

## What Causes A Lava Yuva 2 Screen Unresponsive?

There are several reasons why a Lava Yuva 2 phone's screen may become unresponsive. Some common causes include software issues, hardware problems, or issues with the touchscreen itself. It's essential to identify the root cause of the problem to fix it properly.

Below are some possible causes of Lava Yuva 2 screen unresponsiveness, along with explanations of each.

- **Soft-bricked software:** Soft-bricking refers to the state where the phone is stuck in an infinite boot loop or unable to boot. It can occur due to corrupt system files, outdated firmware, or unsuccessful updates. For example, some Lava Yuva 2 Y2 and 5A users have reported their screens getting stuck on the boot logo after a software update, rendering the Lava Yuva 2 device unusable.

- **Equipment is worn out:** Hardware problems can also cause Lava Yuva 2 screens to become unresponsive. It can be due to worn-out equipment, such as a damaged LCD screen, malfunctioning touch sensor, or loose ribbon cables. These issues can also occur in any Lava Yuva 2 model, including the Y2 and 5A.

- **Touchscreen problems:**Sometimes, the touchscreen itself can become unresponsive for various reasons. For instance, Lava Yuva 2 Y2 and 5A users may face this issue if they have accidentally dropped their phone, exposed it to water, or used an incompatible screen protector. It can result in a damaged or malfunctioning touchscreen, making it difficult or impossible to operate the phone.

## The Common Solutions To Solve A Lava Yuva 2 Screen Unresponsive

In the previous section, we identified the possible causes of Lava Yuva 2 screen unresponsiveness, including soft-bricked software, hardware problems, and touchscreen issues. While the underlying reasons for screen unresponsiveness can be varied and complex, some common solutions can help resolve the issue. Here are three of the most common solutions to address tablet screen unresponsiveness, no matter the Lava Yuva 2 model.

### 1. Restart The Device

![mui restart button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reset-button-android-1.jpg)

Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Lava Yuva 2 black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

After fully discharging the battery, the Lava Yuva 2 device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

## Part 1. What are Brick Phones: At a Glance

The term "**bricked phone**" is used when a device becomes non-functional. This is typically due to a critical software or firmware error. There are two distinct scenarios for encountering a bricked phone: a soft brick and a hard brick.

- **Soft Brick**. A soft brick entails a phone that's not operational due to software glitches or conflicts but is not irreparable.
- **Hard Brick**.A hard brick signifies a more dire situation. This is where the phone becomes inoperable, resembling an actual brick in terms of functionality.

### The Common Causes of a Cell Phone Bricking

When a firmware or system update fails, it can lead to a **bricked phone**. Updates involve intricate changes to the phone's software. If interrupted or incompatible, the Lava Yuva 2 device may get stuck in a state of partial functionality. This can result in a soft brick.

#### Failed Flashing

Flashing involves [installing custom firmware](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) or software onto a device. If the flashing process is interrupted or if the firmware used is not compatible with the Lava Yuva 2 device's hardware, it can cause a hard brick. The device's essential software components may become corrupted, rendering the phone unusable.

#### Rooting

## Conclusion

You can fix the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error on Android in different ways. But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.

Although there are ways to bypass the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.

If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.
