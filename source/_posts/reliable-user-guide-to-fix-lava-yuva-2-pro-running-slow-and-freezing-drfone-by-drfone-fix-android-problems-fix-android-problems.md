### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Lava Yuva 2 Pro contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Lava Yuva 2 Pro is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Lava Yuva 2 Pro is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Lava Yuva 2 Pros.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Lava Yuva 2 Pro is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device. So if your Lava Yuva 2 Pro is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement.

### Animation Speed is Way Too Slow

You can modify the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device’s animation type and speed on your Lava Yuva 2 Pro via the developer’s option.

1. **Software Glitch:** Android systems may experience temporary glitches due to factors like memory management issues, conflicts between apps or services, or system updates.

5. **System Updates:** Most of the time, it happens whenever a device is restarted after updating its Android version. Your device could have undergone a bad update or might have had an unsupported driver. This can result in the occurrence of **process system not responding** issue.
6. **Corrupt Cache Files:** Corrupted cache files can lead to conflicts and result in error.
7. **Overclocking or Modifications:** Rooting or modifying the Android device, or applying overclocking settings, can lead to instability and the process system not responding error.
8. **Hardware Issues:** Rarely, hardware problems like failing components can interfere with the proper functioning of the system.

### Fix 6: Check the SD card

If you are still getting the **process system isn’t responding** to Android error, then chances are that there could be an issue with your SD card. Firstly, check if your SD card is working fine or not. If it is corrupted, then get another memory card for your phone. Also, it should have a prominent amount of free storage. You might be facing this issue if the SD card has limited free space.

Also, if you are storing apps on the SD card, then your phone might encounter the process isn’t responding issue whenever you run a respective app. Therefore, you should move apps from your SD card to the phone’s internal memory. To do this, go to your phone’s Settings > Application Manager and select any app. If the app is stored on the SD card, then you will get an option of “Move to devise storage”. Just tap on it and manually move every app to your device storage.
