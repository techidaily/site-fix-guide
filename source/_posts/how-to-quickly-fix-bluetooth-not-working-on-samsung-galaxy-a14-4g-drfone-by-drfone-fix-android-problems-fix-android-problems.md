Every service on your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G using a feature called a cache. This is where information is stored to help the feature run properly and give you the best experience. However, over time this can get messy and can cause problems with your Bluetooth feature.

![android bluetooth problems - remove paired devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-paried.jpg)

Sometimes, you may have a problem with the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.
2. Turn Bluetooth on, and you’ll see all the connections your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G is paired with
3. Go through these settings and remove/delete/forget every connection on your device
4. Now when you go to connect to a device using Bluetooth, repair the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device, enter the passcode, and use a fresh paired connection.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode
4. Wait a minute on the Main Menu
5. Now turn on your Bluetooth and connect it to your preferred device

### 2.6 Turn on the discoverable feature

![android bluetooth problems - discoverable feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-discoverable.jpg)

To ensure your Bluetooth can connect to other devices, it’s important to make sure you’re making your device discoverable to other Bluetooth devices. If it’s hidden, other devices won’t be able to find it, and sometimes it can bug and prevent connections.

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G
4. If the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

## Part 4: Update software to the latest version to fix Android phone keeps turning off

Software glitches or outdated operating systems can trigger automatic shutdowns on Android phones. Updating your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G's software version can be an effective solution to fix the issue of the phone repeatedly turning off. Regular software updates provided by the phone manufacturer often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. These updates can address underlying problems that may be causing the random shutdowns, ensuring a more stable and reliable phone performance.

To update the software on your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G, follow these steps:

Go to "Settings" on your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G and navigate to the "System" or "Software Update" section (the exact wording may vary depending on your device model and Android version). Look for the option to "Check for updates" to see if any new software updates are available.

## Part 5: Cool down your phone to avoid your phone keeps turning off

When a phone overheats, it can trigger an automatic shutdown as a protective mechanism to prevent damage to the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device's internal components. Overheating occurs when the phone's internal temperature rises significantly, typically due to excessive heat generated by the processor and other hardware components during intensive tasks or prolonged usage.

To prevent the phone from turning off due to overheating, you can take various measures, such as limiting intensive usage, avoiding direct sunlight and hot environments, and using the phone on hard surfaces to aid heat dissipation.

![cool down the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/07/phone-keeps-turning-off-1.jpg)

## Part 6: Narrow down the randomly turning off issue in Safe Mode

Starting your phone in Safe Mode is a good way to narrow down whether or not the problem is occurring because of some heavy and incompatible Apps as Safe Mode allows only built-in Apps to function. If you can use your phone in Safe Mode, consider deleting the unnecessary Apps which may be burdening the phone’s processor.

To boot into Safe Mode:

Long press the power button to see the following options on the screen.

![device options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529157169.jpeg)

Now tap on “Power Off” for about 10 seconds and click “OK” on the message that pops-up as shown below.

![safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529389258.jpg)

Once done, the phone will reboot and you will see “Safe Mode” on the main screen.

![safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994529591962.jpg)

That's all. Well, booting to Safe Mode is easy and it also helps you to identify the real problem.
