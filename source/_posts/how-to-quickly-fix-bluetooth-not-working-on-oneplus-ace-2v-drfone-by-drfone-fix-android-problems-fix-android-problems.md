### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your OnePlus Ace 2V in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode
4. Wait a minute on the Main Menu
5. Now turn on your Bluetooth and connect it to your preferred device

### 2.6 Turn on the discoverable feature

![android bluetooth problems - discoverable feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-discoverable.jpg)

To ensure your Bluetooth can connect to other devices, it’s important to make sure you’re making your device discoverable to other Bluetooth devices. If it’s hidden, other devices won’t be able to find it, and sometimes it can bug and prevent connections.

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the OnePlus Ace 2V device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your OnePlus Ace 2V, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your OnePlus Ace 2V from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the OnePlus Ace 2V device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your OnePlus Ace 2V
4. If the OnePlus Ace 2V devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your OnePlus Ace 2V

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the OnePlus Ace 2V devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your OnePlus Ace 2V to the OnePlus Ace 2V device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

Screen Mirroring

## Part 1. Preliminary Reasons For Cellular Network Not Available For Voice Calls

Facing the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error can be overwhelming. Thus, it becomes evident that specific reasons underlie this issue. Solutions indeed exist to tackle this problem. Yet, comprehending the underlying reasons is equally crucial to resolve the issue:

### 1\. Internet Access

One primary reason behind cellular network unavailability glitches lies in unstable internet access. Voice calls over cellular networks often require a stable internet connection. When this connection fluctuates or drops, it can result in the dreaded error message.

### 2\. Terrain Coverage

Another contributing factor is the geographical terrain. In remote or sparsely populated areas, cellular tower coverage might be limited. It causes a signal disturbance or complete loss of the network.

During peak usage hours or in densely populated areas, network congestion can also be a cause. It leads to temporary unavailability of the cellular network for voice calls. When the network is overloaded with traffic, it might struggle to accommodate more voice calls. That results in connectivity issues.

### 4\. Technical Glitches

Furthermore, technical glitches within the OnePlus Ace 2V device or network infrastructure can cause this issue. These glitches could range from software bugs to hardware malfunctions.

### 5\. Battery or Power Issues

In some instances, [<u>insufficient battery power</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-your-phone-battery-health.html) or power-saving modes on devices can cause this issue.

### Solution 1. Check the Availability of Cellular Networks

Before diving into complex fixes, the first thing to do is to check if nearby cell networks are available and how strong their signals are. It is an essential step when trying to fix the "**Cellular Network Not Available**" error. This basic check ensures your phone is close enough to a working network tower, which matters for staying connected. It allows you to find out the availability of nearby cellular networks.

Moreover, with it, you can ensure your device is connected to a reliable network. This preliminary check sets the foundation for further troubleshooting.

### Solution 2. Check the Airplane Mode of the Smartphone

Another crucial step in resolving this error involves ensuring that the Airplane Mode is disabled. This mode, when activated, disables all wireless connections. It also includes cellular networks, which could lead to connectivity issues. Follow these simple steps to check and disable Airplane Mode on your device:

**Instructions:** Swipe down on your phone's screen from the top to access the Notification Panel, unveiling the Quick Settings tiles. Search for the airplane-shaped icon; if Airplane Mode is active, the icon will be highlighted or shown in a distinct color. Tap the Airplane Mode to turn off the Airplane Mode on your Android.

### Solution 3. Selecting the Network Operator of the OnePlus Ace 2V device

In certain instances, manually selecting your network operator can help. It effectively resolves the "**Cellular Network Not Available for Voice Calls Android**" error on your OnePlus Ace 2V. By choosing the network operator manually, you ensure a deliberate connection to a specific carrier. This potentially bypasses issues related to automatic network selection. Follow these steps to select your network operator manually:

### Solution 5. Enable Roaming Settings

There are situations where you're in an area with weak or no coverage from your primary network provider.
