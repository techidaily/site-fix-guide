#### **3\. Shift the App from SD Card to device’s memory**

This method is strictly for certain Apps which cannot be updated because they are stored on an external memory card, i.e., SD Card. Such memory enhancing chips do not support large Apps and due to a shortage of space prevents them from updating. It advisable to move such Apps from the SD Card to the Lava Agni 2 5G device’s internal memory and then try to update it.

Visit “Settings” and select “Apps”.

Try updating the App now. If the Apps’s update does not download even now, DO NOT worry. There are three more ways to help you.

#### **4\. Unmount your external Memory Card**

![select “Unmount SD Card”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984574238529.jpg)

Note: If the App or its update downloads successfully now, do not forget to mount the SD Card back.

#### **5\. Remove and Re-add your Google account**
