### #1. Delete unnecessary files/Apps

Insufficient storage can prevent the app from being installed. Make some storage space on your device by cleaning unwanted data and deleting extra media and other files. You can also get rid of heavy Apps by:

Visiting “Settings” on your device. Then select "Manage apps", "Application Manager" or "Apps" (varies based on device model or version) from the list of options before you.

![application manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994440695192.jpg "application manager")

Now select the App you wish to uninstall and wait for the App Info screen to open, then click on “Uninstall” as shown in the screenshot.

### #4. Choose App location wisely

It is advisable to not tamper with the App’s location and let the software decide where it needs to be placed. As far as possible, let the Apps be in your device’s internal memory.

### #5. Format SD Card

The chances of your SD Card being corrupted are very high. You can format it either while it is in your device or externally.

Now to Clean up your SD Card, simply visit “Settings” and select “Storage” and tap on “Format SD Card” and mount it once again to use it smoothly.

### #6. App Permissions

You can reset App permissions to combat the Android App not installed error by Visiting “Settings” and then selecting “Apps”. Now access the Apps menu and hit “Reset App Preferences” or “Reset application permissions”. This will allow third-party apps to get installed on your device.

### #7. Choose the correct App file

Make sure to always download an App file only from a trusted and safe source to avoid any errors during installation.

### #8. Reboot your device

Finally, if nothing else works, restart your device to end all operations which could be causing the said error. To reboot, just press the power button till you see a pop-up. Select “Restart” and wait for your device to reboot.
