Make sure to regularly check for and install software updates on your Vivo Y78t phone. These updates often include bug fixes and security patches that can help prevent issues like overheating and screen unresponsiveness.

### Check Hardware from Time to Time

Regularly inspect your phone's hardware components such as charging ports, battery, and screen for any signs of damage or wear and tear. If you notice any issues, get them fixed promptly to prevent them from causing further damage.

### Avoid extreme temperatures

Keep your Vivo Y78t device in a temperature-controlled environment. High temperatures can cause the screen to become unresponsive, and low temperatures can cause it to freeze.

### Keep the screen clean

Dirt and debris on the screen can cause it to become unresponsive. Use a microfiber cloth to clean the screen regularly.

### Reduce the number of running apps

Running too many apps at once can overload the system and cause the screen to become unresponsive. Close any apps you're not using to free up system resources.
