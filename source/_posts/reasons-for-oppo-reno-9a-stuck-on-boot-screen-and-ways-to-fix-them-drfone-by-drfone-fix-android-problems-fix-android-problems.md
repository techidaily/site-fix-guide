## Part 1. Why Is Your Oppo Reno 9A Stuck on the Boot Screen?

There are countless reasons why a problem happens, just like why your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page. This section sieved out the top 3 reasons why your ****Android boot screen**** happens and some tips to overcome it.

### 1. Changes to the Software

Android is a flexible operating system. It allows users to customize it in any way they desire, which is Android’s beauty. The customizable nature of the operating system allows users to unlock, root, flash, and tinker. However, this flexibility in customization might be a double edge sword. Accidental tampering with the Android system might result in software problems, such as being stuck on the ****Android boot screen****.

Fortunately, this is not a complicated fix. Android accepts different fixes and allows the system to return to how it once was. Even with software issues, the system does not get completely inoperable. The best way to fix changes to the software is to start from the beginning of the process. This might offer the best chance for you to restore your phone to normal.

Although it is fun to customize and change the software, following trusted sources ensures you do not damage your phone. Having an ****Android phone stuck on the logo**** page is one of the many examples of the problems that might happen if changes to the software go out of hand.

### 2. Android Software Updates

Updates are a common cause of ****Android phones stuck on the logo****. It happened when the update did not complete as it should have been. Several reasons for incomplete updates, such as poor internet connection, the connection between computer and phone being lost, a power cut, the phone freezing, and the list go on. When an update is uncompleted, issues such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen**** and many others might occur.

Before an update starts, your mobile device will notify you of the duration of the update. As a tip, set aside an additional 10-15 minutes on top of the update duration to ensure your update is completed successfully. It will be ideal for activating the software update only when there is sufficient power in your phone or keep it charging during the update.

When an update is disrupted or stopped before it completes, the existing Android version will become corrupted while the new software to be updated is incomplete. This means that your Oppo Reno 9A has no system to run on. Always complete your software updates, and you will not have the problem of your ****Android phone getting stuck on the logo****.

### 3. Malfunctioning Applications

If you noticed that your ****Android phone is stuck on the logo**** page only after installing certain apps, there is a high chance that the app is not compatible with the existing apps in your phone or with the Android version. When an app conflicts with the Android system or other apps, this will run into problems with your phone.

This problem typically happens when an app is downloaded from a third-party source, not the official Google Play Store. This app from a third-party source might be malicious or contain a virus. This can cause problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

To overcome this, locate the app that has been giving you issues and remove the app from your phone. Restart your device, and you should be able to have your Oppo Reno 9A functioning properly.

### 4. Wipe Cache Data

Cache refers to a software or hardware component of an Android device that stores your program and data for reference. This data might result from the daily usage of your device or duplicate data from a different source on the Oppo Reno 9A device. Similar to a computer, if the cache occupies too much space on your device, it might cause your Oppo Reno 9A to become slower and eventually get stuck at the ****Android boot screen****.

Wiping out the cache data from your Oppo Reno 9A could free up more space, allow your device to function faster, and avoid problems such as being stuck at the ****Android boot screen****. Do not worry; wiping the cache data is entirely safe and will not lead to any loss of important data or programs on your phone.

### 5. Factory Reset

If all the methods above fail, performing a factory rest might be your last option. However, it is important to note that performing a factory reset will erase everything on your phone, including apps, contacts, photos, etc. As a tip, back up all your data from your device before performing a factory reset. That way, you can still retrieve all your precious information after the reset.

Follow the steps below to perform a factory rest on your Oppo Reno 9A:

**Step 1:** Turn off your phone and press the Power button and Volume Down button at the same time

**Step 2:** Use the Volume button to scroll the options and highlight Wipe data/factory reset. Press the Power button to begin the factory reset.

## Part 2. 10 common ways to fix Android won't charge

### 1\. Check/replace charging cable

Charging cables fray or become defunct after prolonged usage. Therefore, it is advised to always use the Oppo Reno 9A device’s original charging cable or purchase a good quality charging cord, which doesn't damage your device or your adapter.

It is also very commonly observed that the charging end of the cable which gets connected to the charging port of the Oppo Reno 9A device gets damaged and prevents the current from flowing to the phone/tablet.

### 2\. Check/clean charging port

The charging port in your device is a small opening where the charging end of the cabbie is inserted for the current to flow to the phone/tablet. Very often, we notice that the charging port gets blocked with tiny particles of dirt. The charging port might also get clogged if dirt and dust get accumulated in it, preventing the sensors from receiving and forwarding the current to the Oppo Reno 9A device.

![check charging port](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14985459938188.jpg)

## Scenario 7. Phone Hangs on Installed App

There are scenarios where a phone, like the Oppo Reno 9A 3, hangs or gets stuck on a specific installed app. It happens during the startup process, and it can prevent the Oppo Reno 9A device from turning on properly. This issue often arises due to a malfunctioning or poorly coded app. This app disrupts the Oppo Reno 9A device's startup routine, causing **Oppo Reno 9A 4 won’t turn on**.

### Reason 1. Third-Party Apps Interference

**Solution:** Start by booting the Oppo Reno 9A 3 into Safe Mode. This mode disables third-party apps, allowing you to access the Oppo Reno 9A device without interference from downloaded applications.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### Reason 2. Problematic App

**Solution:** While in Safe Mode, observe if the Oppo Reno 9A device boots up properly. If it successfully boots, it suggests that a third-party application is causing the problem. To pinpoint the problematic app, uninstall recently added apps individually and restart the Oppo Reno 9A device after each removal. This process helps pinpoint the problematic app causing the hang during startup.

![uninstall app in google pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/google-pixel-3-wont-turn-on-18.jpg)

### Reason 3. Stacked Up App Cache and Data

**Solution:** If the problematic app is identified, try clearing its cache and data. Go to Settings and then access "Apps." Within "Apps," find the Problematic App and tap "Storage & cache." On the subsequent display, select "[Clear cache](https://drfone.wondershare.com/erase-android/clear-cache-android.html)" and "Clear storage" to restore the application to its original settings.

![clear storage and cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/google-pixel-3-wont-turn-on-19.jpg)

### Reason 4. Outdated Application

**Solution:** If the application is essential, ensure to seek updates within the Google Play Store. Updating the app to its latest version could potentially resolve any compatibility issues. Alternatively, if updates are not available or don’t resolve the problem, consider uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
