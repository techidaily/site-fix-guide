It is appropriate to tag our generation as smartphone addicts because we use smartphones for anything and everything. All our important information, such as photos, videos, audio files, documents, notes, calendars, emails, etc, are stored on our phones. This causes a major storage/space problem in our phones and **a shortage of storage space** is one of the main reasons why an App won’t open or why all Apps won't open on your Honor 70 Lite 5G. To see how much of your storage space is occupied by Apps, go to “Settings” and select “Application Manager”.

![Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583143306.jpg)

Another possible reason for Apps to crash or why an App won't open is a possible data crash. This may occur due to **an unstable internet connection** or **various other background software interruptions**.

The causes for the problem to occur are many and no specific reason can be established as the only reason why Apps won't open on your Honor 70 Lite 5G.

## Part 3: 3 Common fixes if a particular App won’t open

In this segment, we will discuss the three best ways to help you fix the problem if only a particular App won't open/launch/ run and takes an indefinite time to load.

1\. Update the App

It is always advisable to keep your Android software as well as your Apps up-to-date and you must constantly check for any updates which may be available in the Google Play Store.

Follow the steps given below to update the app which won't open on your phone:

• Visit Google Play Store on your Honor 70 Lite 5G.

![Visit Google Play Store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583996008.jpg)

• Now select “My Apps & Games” from the main menu.

![select “My Apps & Games](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183627979.jpg)

• In this step, you may click on “Update All” to update all Apps for which an update is available or manually select the Apps which you wish to Update.

![Update All](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183782889.jpg)

Once the App is updated, close all Apps and tabs running in the background. Now try to launch the app once again. If it opens, your problem is solved. If not, DO NOT worry as there are more ways to help you.

2\. Force Stop the App

Closing the App completely which won't open on your phone is a good idea. To make sure that no operations are running in the background related to the App, you must “Force Stop” it. Doing this is extremely simple and all you need to do is follow the steps given herein under:

• Visit “Settings” on your phone.

• Click on “Apps” to see a list of all the Apps on your Honor 70 Lite 5G.

Updating your Android software solves most of your problems. This method might sound weird but works wonders when it comes to App related issues.

Your phone will automatically restart and once it does, you can try to launch the App. You may also restart your Honor 70 Lite 5G by pressing the power button for about 15-20 seconds.

3\. Reset Factory Settings

This method is a little tedious and must be last on your list. Also, make sure you take a backup of all your data and contents stored on your Honor 70 Lite 5G and this solution will completely wipe off your phone making as good as a new smartphone.

To Factory Reset your Honor 70 Lite 5G, carefully follow the guidelines given below:

Your phone will now reboot and will be required to set up from scratch.
