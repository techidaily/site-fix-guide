**Method 2. [Mock Locations](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.gavrikov.mocklocations)**

Android users can try out the Mock Locations application to spoof their GPS tracker for fake locations on different apps on the phone. It helps change the location coordinates of the user that Network and GPS service providers typically track.

Instead, while using this app, you can set up start and end points for your route on a map and automatically start creating a route between the points.

**Key Features**:

- A simple joystick is available for controlling location and movement when you use this for spoofing.
- Set brakes before any bend in the route.
- Specify closed movement route.
- Set up breakpoints easily.

**Pros**:

- Very lightweight.
- Use the GPX file to replay the route.
- Set up variable speeds.

**Cons**:

- Speed can fluctuate.
- Bugs can occur when users keep it active for longer periods non-stop.

**How to use it?**

**Step 1:** Install the app and launch it. Give app access permissions.

**Step 2**: Long-tap points on the map to mark starting and ending locations. The app will automatically start evaluating suitable routes.

**Step 3:** Click on the confirm tick mark icon. Follow developer permission settings-related steps, and tap on Go.
