With GPS and advanced tracking tools, your whereabouts can be easily located all the time. With advanced technology and features, spying on your phone has become easier than ever before. So, if you are also doubting that your spouse is spying on your phone, you are reading on the right page.

If you are suspecting that your phone is being hacked, several signs will indicate the same. So, if you too are looking for ways **how to know if someone is spying on cell phones, check the below-listed signs.**

### 4\. Monitoring your mail, email, phone calls, and/or text messages

When your emails, phone calls, and text messages are being checked or tracked that means your phone is being hacked.

### 5\. Monitoring your use of social media (such as Facebook)

If your social media accounts like Facebook and others are kept an eye on it means that you are being watched and your phone is being hacked. Tracking you or your vehicle using GPS

### Response 2: Stop your spouse from spying on you by actionable methods
