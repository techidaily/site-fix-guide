### Physical Damage to the Phone

If you accidentally dropped your phone or knocked it on a hard surface, you could have damaged the internal hardware of your phone. This could affect your phone’s ability to reboot and result in your ****phone being stuck on the boot screen****.

If you are 100% certain that your phone has gone through physical damage, you should seek professional help to have your phone repaired or checked. It is advised not to fix this problem yourself as your phone’s internal parts are complicated and delicate. Look for an official phone repair store and get your phone fixed for issues like your ****phone getting stuck on the logo.****

### Liquid Damage

It is not common for your phone to expose to water. Rain or water splashes are unavoidable; sometimes, your phone gets wet. Little exposure to water on the surfaces of your phone is fine. However, if you fall into a pool with your phone or drop it in a puddle of water, your phone will likely suffer from liquid damage.

Even the tiniest water droplet that seeped into your phone could damage the internal hardware of your device, often leaving you with your ****phone stuck on the boot screen****. The first thing to do when you accidentally submerge your phone in the water is to check if the water has damaged your phone.

For iPhone users, look for the water damage indicator. If you see that it has turned from white to red, it has suffered from water damage. You have two options if your phone has suffered liquid damage. One is dismantling your phone and letting it dry for at least 48 hours. Two is bringing your phone to a repair shop to fix it.

![iphone water indicator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-02.jpg)

### Software Issues

Software issues are probably the most common reason your ****phone is stuck on the logo**** screen. Eight times out of ten, software issues are either caused by a failed software update, using an older version of the operating system, or having a jailbroken phone. When the software does not successfully update, the phone will have no operating system, as the old system was erased before the new software was installed.

The older operating system is also not desired as your phone typically will send periodic updates to make sure your phone is up-to-date and free from bugs. Running applications on an older operating system might lead to issues like the ****phone being stuck on the boot screen or the logo.**** Hence, updating your phone to the latest software version would be better.

## Part 2. 3 Helpful Ways To Fix Phones Stuck on Boot Screen

### Put your phone in recovery mode

If a hard reboot does not work, a natural next step is to try going into recovery mode. The recovery mode is specially designed to solve any software-related issues. It is important to note that entering recovery mode will delete all your corrupted files and replace them with a functional operating system. Hence, back up all your files to ensure you retain all your information.

Here is a step-by-step process for putting your Motorola Moto G34 5G or Redmi smartphone in recovery mode.

****Step 1****: Tap and press the Power button to switch off your Motorola Moto G34 5G/Redmi phone

****Step 2****:Hold the Volume Up and the Power buttons at the same time, then release the keys when the Main menu of Recovery mode appears on the screen.

****Step 3****: You can use the volumes buttons to navigate up and down and press the Power key to confirm the selection.

### Factory Reset

If you do not want to attempt recovery mode, you can try resolving the issue of your **phone being stuck on the startup screen** through Factory Reset. Factory Reset, also called Hard Reset, erases all information and data on your device. As a result, it will return to the settings and recover the data it used to have when leaving the factory.

Here is an example of putting your Samsang smartphone into the Factory Reset DFU mode.

****Step 1****: Open the **Settings** application on your phone and **tap General Management**.

![general management on samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/reasons-for-phones-stuck-on-startup-screen-and-ways-to-fix-them-05.jpg)

****Step 2****: Go to **Reset** > **Factory data reset.**

****Step 3****: Swipe to and tap **Reset**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

The following are interesting and frequently asked questions about how to solve boot loops.

1. What is a boot loop?

A boot loop describes a process when Your Motorola Moto G34 5G stays stuck in a circle of rebooting. When your phone is ****stuck on the startup screen****, one of the strategies you will try is to restart your device. However, when your phone gets stuck in a boot loop, it is your device’s way of trying to turn it off and on again to fix the issue.

2. How do you fix a boot loop?

When stuck in a boot loop, there are different troubleshooting methods for other devices. For Android phones, force your phone into its Recovery mode; from there, you can restore a previous backup. This backup could be from when the boot loop did not exist, so recovery to that backup could quickly solve the problem.

For iPhones, it is the same concept as the Android, restore your phone to the previous backup. You can use iTunes to restore a previously stored backup on your computer.

3. How to prevent a boot loop?

A boot loop typically starts when there is a change to your system before a reboot cycle.

Make your phone juiced to prevent it from turning off mid-way when updating.

### 7. Update Your App

If your system is updated, then Spotify might need an update. The app might malfunction if you’re using an older version. Thus, updating the app might solve the Spotify crashing problem. You can update Spotify by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the **Play Store**.

![play store on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-14.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### 8. Free up Storage

Spotify can start crashing if your Android’s storage space is at capacity. That can also cause other apps to crash, not only Spotify. Therefore, check the storage space and free up as much as possible. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Here, you can see how much of your storage space is available and what’s taking up the most space.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




- **Step 4:** Then, you can go ahead and clear as much space as you can.

### 9. Reinstall Spotify

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several websites that check real-time app servers and if they’re down.

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **Apps**.
- **Step 3:** Find **Spotify** and tap it.

![spotify in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-23.jpg)
