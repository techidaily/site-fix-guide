1. Turn your HTC U23 off by holding down the Power button
2. Wait for several minutes and then turn your phone on again
3. Wait for your phone to completely power up, so you’re on the Main Menu
4. Navigate Settings > Bluetooth and then enable the setting
5. Try to connect your Bluetooth device to what you were trying to do before

### 2.3 Clear the Bluetooth cache

![android bluetooth problems - clear cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-cache.jpg)

Every service on your HTC U23 using a feature called a cache. This is where information is stored to help the feature run properly and give you the best experience. However, over time this can get messy and can cause problems with your Bluetooth feature.

By clearing the cache, you can restart the service and hopefully clear up any issues or problems you may be experiencing.

1. On your phone, navigate Settings > Application Manager, and you’ll see all the apps and services on your phone. Locate and select the Bluetooth service.
2. Select the Storage option
3. Tap the Clear Cache option
4. Go back of the Menu and restart your phone
5. Now turn your Bluetooth feature on and turn connecting it to your preferred device

### 2.4 Remove paired devices

![android bluetooth problems - remove paired devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-paried.jpg)

Sometimes, you may have a problem with the HTC U23 device you’re trying to connect to via Bluetooth, especially if this is a device you’ve updated. To counter and repair this, you’re going to need to remove the paired devices saved with your device and then reconnect them.

Here’s how;

1. From the Main Menu of your HTC U23, head to Settings > Bluetooth > Connected Devices.
2. Turn Bluetooth on, and you’ll see all the connections your HTC U23 is paired with
3. Go through these settings and remove/delete/forget every connection on your device
4. Now when you go to connect to a device using Bluetooth, repair the HTC U23 device, enter the passcode, and use a fresh paired connection.

### 2.5 Use Bluetooth in safe mode

![android bluetooth problems - safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-safemode.jpg)

If you’re having problems with your connection and paired devices, sometimes you may have conflicting software faults in your device that are causing the problems. If this is the case, you’ll need to boot your HTC U23 in Safe Mode.

This is an operating state in which your phone will run the bare minimum services it needs to perform. If your Bluetooth works in Safe Mode, you know you have an app or a service that’s causing the problem.

Here’s how to find out;

1. Hold the power button down, so the Android power menu turns on
2. Long-press the power button again and the restart in Safe Mode option will come up
3. The phone will automatically boot into Safe Mode
4. Wait a minute on the Main Menu
5. Now turn on your Bluetooth and connect it to your preferred device

### 2.6 Turn on the discoverable feature

![android bluetooth problems - discoverable feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-discoverable.jpg)

To ensure your Bluetooth can connect to other devices, it’s important to make sure you’re making your device discoverable to other Bluetooth devices. If it’s hidden, other devices won’t be able to find it, and sometimes it can bug and prevent connections.

Here’s how to turn on your Bluetooth discoverable feature;

1. From the home screen of your Android, navigate to the Menu> Settings > Bluetooth
2. Toggle the Bluetooth switch, so it’s on
3. Under the available settings, tick the box that allows your Bluetooth device to be discoverable
4. Turn your Bluetooth feature on and connect to the HTC U23 device you’re trying to connect too

### 2.7 Exclude Bluetooth issues of the other device

![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your HTC U23, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

1. Disconnect your HTC U23 from the Bluetooth device and turn your Bluetooth off
2. Now take another Bluetooth device and connect this to the HTC U23 device you’re trying to connect too. This could be another Android device, or even a computer or iOS device
3. If the new device doesn’t connect to your Bluetooth device, you’ll know there’s a problem with your Bluetooth device, not your HTC U23
4. If the HTC U23 devices connect, you’ll know there’s a problem with your HTC U23

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the HTC U23 devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your HTC U23 to the HTC U23 device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

First and foremost, the thing that can let you get rid of this trouble is Safe Mode. It is a feature that will end any excessive background functioning of the HTC U23 device. For instance, your device will be able to run sans any third-party apps when in Safe mode.

### 2.3 Update Google Play services

Since Android is created by Google, there must be some Google Play services that are crucial to run several system functions. And if attempting the previous methods isn’t of any use, try updating Google Play services when you find the Phone app stopped. For doing this, you need to make sure that automatic updates are turned on in Google settings. If not, enable it and get the apps including Google Play services updated for smoother functions.

### 2.4 Update the HTC U23 firmware

1. Open "Settings" and go to "About Device".

![Phone app crashing - update firmware](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/samsung-android-update-shot.jpg)

1. Download and install it and then try to use the Phone app.

### 2.5 Clear partition cache

Here is another resolution for the "Unfortunately Phone has stopped" error. Clearing the partition cache will remove the whole cache of the HTC U23 device and make it work like before.

1. Switch off your device to begin with and enter the recovery mode by pressing the "Home", "Power" and "Volume Up" buttons.

However, like any other electronic device, HTC U23 phones can sometimes encounter issues, such as an unresponsive screen. The causes of an unresponsive screen may include overheating, physical damage, and manufacturing defects.

To deal with an unresponsive screen, users can try restarting the HTC U23 device, checking the charging port and battery, or contacting a professional. Additional solutions for specific HTC U23 models include checking the phone's temperature, resetting to factory settings, or replacing a new screen. To avoid an unresponsive screen, users can check software updates on time, inspect the phone's hardware, avoid extreme temperatures, keep the screen clean, and reduce the number of running apps. Dr.Fone is a helpful tool that can help manage and repair your phone's data.
