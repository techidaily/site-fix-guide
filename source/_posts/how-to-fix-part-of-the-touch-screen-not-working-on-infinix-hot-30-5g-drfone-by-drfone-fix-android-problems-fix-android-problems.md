### Solution 5. Reset to Factory Settings

Sometimes, clearing the cache partition doesn't help resolve the touchscreen issue. In that case, You have to factory reset your Infinix Hot 30 5G device. It is the best and last solution if other fixes haven't worked and you can't pinpoint the reason. Factory resetting your Infinix Hot 30 5G will delete all phone data. Thus, you should create a proper backup before trying this fix. Follow these steps to factory reset your Infinix Hot 30 5G in no time:

### Solution 6. Replace the Old Screen with A New Screen

If none of the above-mentioned fixes have worked so far, you should replace the touch screen. Replacing the touch screen is recommended in case of hardware and severe software issues. However, it can be quite an expensive fix as new touch screens aren't cheap. The prices for new touchscreens differ depending on the model. These prices start from $20 and go up to hundreds of dollars.
