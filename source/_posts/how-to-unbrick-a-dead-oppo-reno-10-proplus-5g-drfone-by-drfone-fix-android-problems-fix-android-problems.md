- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.

### Common Reasons for Your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

## Part 3: How to fix App not installed error on Android

We understand that it can be a tricky situation to be in when Android App not installed error pops up, but what if we tell you can get rid of it in easy and simple steps? Yes, there is!

### #1. Delete unnecessary files/Apps

Insufficient storage can prevent the app from being installed. Make some storage space on your device by cleaning unwanted data and deleting extra media and other files. You can also get rid of heavy Apps by:

Visiting “Settings” on your device. Then select "Manage apps", "Application Manager" or "Apps" (varies based on device model or version) from the list of options before you.

![application manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994440695192.jpg "application manager")

Now select the App you wish to uninstall and wait for the App Info screen to open, then click on “Uninstall” as shown in the screenshot.

You can also uninstall the unnecessary application on the home screen, just long-press the app you want to uninstall until you see the "uninstall" icon. Click "Uninstall", then, you need to click "OK" to confirm the uninstall process.

### #2. Use only Google Play Store

As you are all aware, the Play Store is specially designed for Android software and contains only trusted and safe Apps. It is often known as the “Android Market” because it is loaded with different types of Apps to stiffly all your needs so that you don't have to rely on other third-party sources to purchase/install Apps.

### #3. Mount your SD Card

Another remedy for Android App not installed error is to make sure that the SD card inserted in your device is not inaccessible.

![mount sd card](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/android-app-not-installed.jpg "mount sd card")

To check the same:

First, disconnect your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G from your PC and then visit “Settings” on your Android and select “Storage” from the options that appear. Finally, click on “Mount SD Card” at the Storage Info screen.

You can now restart your device and try to install the app now, it should work!

### #4. Choose App location wisely

It is advisable to not tamper with the App’s location and let the software decide where it needs to be placed. As far as possible, let the Apps be in your device’s internal memory.

### #5. Format SD Card

The chances of your SD Card being corrupted are very high. You can format it either while it is in your device or externally.

Now to Clean up your SD Card, simply visit “Settings” and select “Storage” and tap on “Format SD Card” and mount it once again to use it smoothly.

### #6. App Permissions

You can reset App permissions to combat the Android App not installed error by Visiting “Settings” and then selecting “Apps”. Now access the Apps menu and hit “Reset App Preferences” or “Reset application permissions”. This will allow third-party apps to get installed on your device.

### #7. Choose the correct App file

Make sure to always download an App file only from a trusted and safe source to avoid any errors during installation.

### #8. Reboot your device

Finally, if nothing else works, restart your device to end all operations which could be causing the said error. To reboot, just press the power button till you see a pop-up. Select “Restart” and wait for your device to reboot.
