## Part 3: Chrome cache overflowing

While using any app for long, the temporary files for those gets collected in the form of cache. And when cache is not getting cleared, one may face the freezing, crashing or sluggish apps. And this could also be the cause why your Chrome keeps stopping. Hence, the following steps will show you how to clear cache and make Chrome work as before.

1\. Open “Settings” and go to “Apps & Notifications”.

2\. Look for “Chrome” and tap on it.

3\. Go to “Storage” and click on “Clear Cache”.

In such case, we would like to recommend you to make use of another browser and try to access the website from there. See if this works or not. If now, please follow the next solution.

Of still you are receiving “Unfortunately Chrome has stopped” pop-up, it might be because of the incompatibility between the Chrome and system. Maybe your device is not updated and therefore is at odds with the Chrome app. So, the last tip that we would like give you is to update your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition. Following are the steps for it. Follow them and stop the Chrome crashing on Android issue.

- Go to “Settings” and tap on “System”/”About Phone”/”About Device”.
- Now, choose “Software Update”/”System Update” and your device will detect if there is any update present on your device. Proceed accordingly.
