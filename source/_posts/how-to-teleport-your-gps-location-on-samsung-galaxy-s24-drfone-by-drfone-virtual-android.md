## Can Life360 Track You When Your Samsung Galaxy S24 is off?

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Did you know that your Samsung Galaxy S24 tracks your location even when turned off? And if you're a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy? Do you want to protect your kids from being tracked by strangers?

Of course Yes! Well, then you should know that Your Samsung Galaxy S24 can track your movements even when switched off. But is that true?

In the event that you switch off your Samsung Galaxy S24, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your Samsung Galaxy S24 is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.

Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy? Let's take a look at the facts.

- [Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part1)
- [Part 2: Does life360 work if the phone is off?](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part2)
- [Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You ![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part3)

## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360. Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Samsung Galaxy S24 and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.

If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.

When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there's no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.

Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your Samsung Galaxy S24 and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.

If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one's privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.

Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days' worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.

## Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You

### 1\. Low Data Consumption

Disabling Life360's Wi-Fi and Data may result in a warning to parents that their children are offline so that they can keep an eye on their kids. Does life 360 drain the battery? Low data mode is a better option for turning off life360 without alerting your parents. Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

Alternatively, you should disable background app refresh, mobile network, physical activity, and WIFI to save battery life. An issue with your Internet connection will come up instead of location stopped in this situation. So don't connect to any Wi-Fi at all.

### 2\. Fake Locations

Using location spoofing applications on an Android smartphone, your kids can fool you into thinking they're somewhere else. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location spoofing application that will trick you into thinking that you are in a different location than you really are. The GPS position of the Samsung Galaxy S24 device will be updated to reflect the new place that you have chosen thanks to the software. It is worth noting that Dr. Fone - Virtual Location for iOS may also enable you to imitate GPS movement.

It has several other noticeable features that can help you in your daily life.

![access virtual location feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You. However, the best all-in-one solution is a third-party application called Dr.Fone. This Virtual Location Software helps you keep your tracking off, but you can also fake your location very easily in minutes.

### Conclusion

Can you track a phone if the location is off? Life360 has become a standard feature of many smartphones. Parents often use it to monitor their children's location. The fact that Life360 can be used to track users is quite disturbing. The good news is that there are ways to stop Life360 from tracking you.

## Thinking About Changing Your Netflix Region Without a VPN On Samsung Galaxy S24?

Netflix is easily one of the most popular streaming apps available today. It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.

The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you're interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.

![change region without vpn netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg)

## Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions

Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.

Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix's Terms of Use. If you're caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant's Terms of Use.

## Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?

If you're wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is ‚ÄúNo, they don't‚Äù. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you're connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.

## Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?

There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you're on your computer, iPhone, or Android. You can use a smart DNS service, a Proxy Server, or a [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to connect to a country you want to access. Follow our guide below to change country on Netflix now without a VPN.

### Method 1: Using a Smart DNS

Utilizing Smart DNS to change country on Netflix without VPN actually works in the same way. This is because Smart DNS re-routes your connection through a server in a different country. Keep in mind that Smart DNS is still a service and will require a subscription from a Smart DNS provider.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different online DNS providers. In this example, you'll see using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**Step 2**: Register your IP address on your selected provider and obtain the appropriate DNS Server Address on your account.

![change dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 3**: Open **Networking** settings on your computer, iPhone, PlayStation, or Xbox and find **DNS Settings** (the image below is an example for the Windows system).

![change dns server wifi properties](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address. Click **Ok** once done and restart your computer. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**Pros**

- DNS servers are faster than a usual internet connection, so you can enjoy streaming at high connection speeds.
- DNS Servers don't encrypt your traffic or hide your IP address.

**Cons**

- DNS doesn't carry your information, as the server side will only see the IP address where the query came from, which hackers can manipulate.

### Method 2: Using a Proxy Server

Proxy Servers work the same as VPNs as it routes traffic to a third-party server. However, like DNS, Proxy Servers don't encrypt data but can mask your IP address. Here are the steps to watch NetFlix with a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Search for **Proxy Settings** on your computer.

![change proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 2**: Choose between **Automatic** or **Manual proxy setup**.

**Step 3A**: For **Automatic proxy setup**, turn on **Automatically detect settings** and **Use setup script.** Afterward, enter the **Script address** and click **Save.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![automatic proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 3B**: For **Manual proxy setup,** click **Use a proxy server**. Input **Address** and **Port** numbers. Click **Save** afterward.

![manual proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-3.jpg)

**Note**

To change Proxy on mobile phones, change your phone's proxy settings. Your Netflix app will automatically copy your phone's proxy settings if done correctly.

**Pros**

- Proxy Servers mask your IP address retaining anonymity.
- Proxies improve web browsing performance, especially when downloading large files.

**Cons**

- Proxy Servers don't encrypt data.

### Method 3: Using a Tor Browser

For the unfamiliar, Tor is an open-source network that encrypts your connection while stopping trackers from following your activity. Here are the steps to start using Tor Browser to watch Netflix without a VPN.

**Step 1**: Download and install [**Tor Browser**](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

![tor browser for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/tor-browser.jpg)

**Step 2**: Launch **Tor Browser** and click **Connect**.

**Step 3**: Go to **Netflix.com** and log in to your account.

**Note**

Tor Browser is available across all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

**Pros**

- Tor is completely free to use.
- Your browsing history automatically gets deleted.

**Cons**

- You can't control the region you have access to, so your Netflix content is not guaranteed to have what you're looking for.

### Conclusion

Changing your Netflix region with or without a VPN certainly has its perks. This is because you can watch your favorite series unavailable to your country to maximize your streaming access. Choosing a country with a lower subscription price also saves you money.

While it's not illegal to change your Netflix region, it does violate the streaming giant's Terms of Use. You should always research and know the pros and cons when circumventing Netflix's terms so your account doesn't get suspended or terminated.
