No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Editions Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Editions Spreading on My Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Editions Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.

### Method 2: Using Safe Mode

Safe Mode is like a secret agent—it helps but with a downside. It turns off third-party apps, making your phone useful only for basic calls or texts. Use this method if any solutions in this section do not work. It’s especially handy if you use your phone before sending it to a technician. This way, you’ll learn **how you can get a virus off your phone** before actually letting a technician do it.

Generally, here’s how you can [enter Safe Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) on Android Phones. Do check with your phone manufacturer’s official manual/guides on how to enter them:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button. Wait for the power options to appear.
- **Step 2:** Tap and hold the **Power Off** button.
- **Step 3:** Tap on the prompt when you see the **Reboot to safe mode** option.

![android safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-11.jpg)

For iPhones, here’s how you can do it:

- **Step 1:** Power off your iPhone.
- **Step 2:** Hold the power button.
- **Step 3:** Hold the volume down button until you see the Apple logo.
- **Step 4:** Your phone should now be in safe mode.

### Method 3: Downloading Anti-Virus Software

Anti-virus software works like a shield, protecting your phone from sneaky viruses and malware. Here are three recommended anti-virus apps that you should try out. They’re available on both the Google Play Store and App Store. So, regardless of what device you’re using, you’re sure to be safe with these:

- Avast Anti-virus – Mobile Security
- Norton 360: Online Security
- Bitdefender Mobile Security & Anti-virus

### Method 4: Performing a Factory Reset

A [Factory Reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-factory-reset-on-android.html) is like a phone makeover—it wipes everything and starts fresh. But be cautious, as it erases all data!

Generally, the Factory Reset option should be in **Settings > General & Backup and reset** or under **Settings > About phone** for Android devices.

![miui factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-13.jpg)

IOS devices should be under **Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone**.

![ios transfer or reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/remove-virus-phone-14.jpg)

Remember, each method has its strengths and weaknesses. Dr.Fone is quick and effective, Safe Mode is limited but useful, anti-virus apps can protect, and a Factory Reset gives a clean slate. Try these methods to zap those viruses away!

## Part 3: Handy Prevention Tips To Avoid Future Infections

To keep your phone safe from viruses, follow these easy tips that act as a shield against potential threats.

- **Regular software updates:**Keep your phone updated with the latest software. Updates often include security patches that protect your phone from new threats.
- **Cautious downloads:**Be careful when downloading apps or files. Stick to trusted sources like Google Play Store or Apple Store. Avoid clicking on suspicious links from unknown sources.

These simple yet crucial tips will fortify your phone’s defenses, reducing the likelihood of virus infections and ensuring a safer digital experience.
