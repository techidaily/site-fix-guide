It is the most commonly used method to fix Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5Glogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G Y2 and Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

- Open the **Settings**.
- Navigate to the A**dditional settings** section of the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G Redmi 5A settings.

- Click**Erase all data (factory reset)** to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G Redmi 5A.
- Select **All files on the phone**to make a complete format of the Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G Redmi 5A.
