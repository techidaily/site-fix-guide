### Fix 6: Clear SIM Toolkit Cache and Data

It is worth considering the SIM Toolkit is a potential source of the problem. The SIM Toolkit is an app that provides functionality related to your SIM card. Its functions include accessing value-added services and managing mobile network settings. Clearing the cache and data of the SIM Toolkit app can help resolve this issue. The steps you need to clear the cache and data of this app are the following:

- ****Step 1:**** On your Sony Xperia 1 V, find the SIM Toolkit app. After finding it, press and hold its icon until a short menu appears. Choose "App Info" from the available options to access its settings.

### Fix 7: Perform Factory Reset

If all previous fixes have been unsuccessful, performing a factory reset is also an option to resolve this issue. It is a drastic measure that can potentially address underlying software issues. However, it's important to note that a factory reset will erase the entire data and settings of your device.

So, it's crucial to back up your important files before proceeding with this fix. By doing so, you can restore your device to its original state and eliminate the error. Use the detailed guide described below to factory reset your Sony Xperia 1 V:

- ****Step 1:**** Start by launching the Settings app and selecting "General Management." Here, choose "Reset," and following that on the next screen, tap "Factory data reset."
