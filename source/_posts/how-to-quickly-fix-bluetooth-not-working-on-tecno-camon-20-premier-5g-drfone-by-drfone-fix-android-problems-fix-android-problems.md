![android bluetooth problems - exclude Bluetooth issues of others](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/android-bluetooth-newphone.jpeg)

Sometimes, you might not even have a problem with your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G, but rather the Bluetooth device you’re trying to connect to, whether that’s a Bluetooth speaker, an in-car entertainment system, or any other kind of Bluetooth device.

By testing out another Bluetooth device to see if it will work with your preferred device, you can rule this out from being the issue.

### 2.8 Place both devices within close proximity

![android bluetooth problems - close proximity](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-android-phones.jpeg)

One of the common misconceptions of Bluetooth is just how far the wireless range is of the service. You need to make sure your devices are well and truly close to each other to make sure a stable connection can be formed.

The further away the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G devices are from each other, the less likely the connection will remain secure. As a rule of thumb, Bluetooth can work up to 100 meters, but to play it safe, always try and keep your devices under 50m apart.

### 2.9 Avoid interference of other Bluetooth sources

![android bluetooth problems - avoid interference](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/04/bluetooth-device-interference.jpg)

The final consideration you’ll want to think about is that Bluetooth radio waves, or wireless waves, can interfere with each other. This means they can bounce off each other or get muddled up and make things confusing from your devices.

With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure you’re limiting the amount of Bluetooth activity in the area where you’re trying to use a device. While uncommon, this could be the problem.

To fix this issue, turn off all the Bluetooth connections in the area. This includes computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and any other Bluetooth devices you may have. Then, try connecting your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G to the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device you were trying to use. If it works, you know you were experiencing Bluetooth interference.

- **Step 3:** Press the **Volume Up**button to enter Download Mode.

The steps for entering Download Mode on Android devices without the Home button are as follows:

![enter download mode without the home button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-system-repair-4.png)

- **Step 1:** Turn off your phone.
- **Step 2:** Press and hold the **Volume Down**, **Bixby**, and**Power** buttons simultaneously.
- **Step 3:** Press the **Volume Up**button to enter Download Mode.

### 2. Force-Close the App

You can force-close Spotify and open it again to make it work properly. That is an easy fix if your Spotify has developed a bug. If that is the case, follow the next steps:

- **Step 1:** Try opening Spotify.
- **Step 2:** If it’s not working, open **App Switcher** or **Recent Apps**. Different Android devices open it differently. Thus, you can swipe up from your Home screen, or if you have three buttons at the bottom, press **Recent Apps**.

![recent apps on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-3.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Find Spotify in **Recent Apps**and click **X** or swipe up over it to force-close it.
- **Step 4:** Try opening Spotify again.

### 3. Re-Login to Your Spotify

The Spotify app may be working fine. Maybe you’re having problems with your Spotify account. If so, you can try logging out and logging in again to see if that works. That isn’t a big problem; sometimes Spotify accounts start bugging. You can re-login to your Spotify account by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open Spotify.
- **Step 2:** Tap **Settings**in the upper right corner.

![settings in spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-4.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Scroll to the bottom of the settings and tap **Log Out**.

![log out of spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-5.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Tap **Log In**.

![log into spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-6.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Enter your login credentials.
- **Step 6:** Tap **Login**again, and you’re in.

![re-login to spotify with your credentials](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-7.jpg)

### 4. Restart Your Device

Another way to stop Spotify from crashing can be restarting your Android. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G device, but they’re mostly the same. Follow these steps to restart your device:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the **Power button**(you must press and hold both the **Power** and **Volume Up** buttons on a newer Android device).
- **Step 2:** Tap **Restart**. That will restart your Android, and you can try opening Spotify again.

![restart android to fix spotify crashing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-8.jpg)

### 5. Set Up Your Time and Date

Another possible reason for your Spotify closing problem could be the incorrect time and date on your Android. That is also an easy fix; you must set it correctly and try opening the app again. Set up your time and date with these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Go to **System**or **General Management** (depending on your Android model).
- **Step 3:** Go to **Date and Time**.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Set Date**and set the correct date.

![set date on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-9.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Go to **Set Time**and set the right time.

![set time on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-10.jpg)

### 6. Update Your System Software

Your Spotify app might keep crashing because your system is outdated. Try updating it to the latest version to try and fix the crashing problem. The steps for the Android system update are as follows:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on your android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **System** or **About Phone**.

![about phone to find system update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-12.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Select **System Update**.
- **Step 4:** If there’s an available update, tap

![install system update on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-13.jpg)

### 7. Update Your App

If your system is updated, then Spotify might need an update. The app might malfunction if you’re using an older version. Thus, updating the app might solve the Spotify crashing problem. You can update Spotify by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the **Play Store**.

![play store on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-14.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Search and open Spotify in the Play Store.
- **Step 3:** Tap Update

![update spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-15.jpg)

### 8. Free up Storage

Spotify can start crashing if your Android’s storage space is at capacity. That can also cause other apps to crash, not only Spotify. Therefore, check the storage space and free up as much as possible. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open
- **Step 2:** Go to **Device Maintenance > Storage**or go directly to Storage.

![storage in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-16.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Here, you can see how much of your storage space is available and what’s taking up the most space.

![available storage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-17.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Then, you can go ahead and clear as much space as you can.

### 9. Reinstall Spotify

There’s another solution if the Spotify app keeps crashing. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling it again on your Android. That will reset the app and might solve your problem. Follow the next steps to reinstall Spotify:

- **Step 1:** Find the Spotify app on your Android.
- **Step 2:** Hold the app icon.
- **Step 3:** Then, press **Uninstall**.

![uninstall spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-18.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Press **OK**.
- **Step 5:** Then, open the PlayStore and find Spotify.
- **Step 6:** Tap **Install**to reinstall the app again.

![reinstall spotify on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-19.jpg)

- **Step 7:** Once it installs, log in to test if it’s working.

### 10. Check if Spotify Is Down

If your Spotify keeps crashing and closing, it might not be your device’s problem. Sometimes, Spotify’s server can be down, and many people face the same issue. If that’s the case, you can check with your friends if their Spotify is working or check online if Spotify is down. To do that, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser.
- **Step 2:** Type “**Is Spotify down**” in the search bar.

![search if spotify is down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-20.jpg)

- **Step 3:** You’ll see several websites that check real-time app servers and if they’re down.

![spotify server up or down](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-21.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Go to one or two and see what they say. If Spotify is down, you’ll need to wait for them to fix the problem.

### 11. Clear the Cache

When using different apps and websites, your device caches data from those sources. Since there’s no need to pile up your Spotify cache, you can clear it. Follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings**.

![settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-22.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Go to **Apps**.
- **Step 3:** Find **Spotify** and tap it.

![spotify in settings on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-23.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Tap **Storage**or **Storage usage**.

![spotify storage usage on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/spotify-keeps-crashing-24.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Tap **Clear Cache**.
