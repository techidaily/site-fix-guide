## Part 5: Wipe cache partition to restore Settings

Like RAM, wiping cache is also vital so as to make the Oppo Find N3 device’s operation smoother. And when you are getting the “Unfortunately Settings has stopped” error, it might be due to the collected cache. To remove it, you will need to enter the recovery mode.

Similarly, [HTC](https://drfone.wondershare.com/htc/htc-recovery-mode.html) and LG device users are supposed to press the “Volume Down” and “Power” buttons. For Nexus, it is “Volume Up, Down” and Power key combinations. Therefore, before going further, make sure what device you own and enter the recovery mode according to it. Now, follow the detailed guide below to wipe the cache partition in order to fix crashing Settings.

1. Primarily, turn off the Oppo Find N3 device and enter the recovery mode by pressing the respective key combinations.
