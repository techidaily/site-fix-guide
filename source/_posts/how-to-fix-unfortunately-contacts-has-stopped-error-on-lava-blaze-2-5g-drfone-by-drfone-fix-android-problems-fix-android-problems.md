Restarting the phone is typically the initial solution that comes to mind when we encounter the Lava Blaze 2 5G black screen problem. It's a simple and widely used method to address the issue, as the black screen problem could be caused by a software glitch, which can often be resolved by freeing up the phone's memory.

It is the most commonly used method to fix Lava Blaze 2 5G's touch screen and power button issues, such as unresponsiveness. By restarting the Lava Blaze 2 5G device, background processes are disabled, and memory is freed up, allowing programs to run smoothly and potentially resolve the problem. To restart a Lava Blaze 2 5G device, press the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously, and release the Power button once the Lava Blaze 2 5Glogo appears.

### 2. Leave The Phone And Let The Battery Drain Completely

![low battery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/drain-your-phone-battery.jpg)

Sometimes, the tablet screen may become unresponsive due to a software issue preventing the Lava Blaze 2 5G device from functioning correctly. Leaving the Lava Blaze 2 5G device unused and draining the battery helps resolve these issues. After fully discharging the battery, the Lava Blaze 2 5G device can be recharged and turned back on, potentially resolving the issue.

### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Lava Blaze 2 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Lava Blaze 2 5G device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Lava Blaze 2 5G Y2 and Lava Blaze 2 5G 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Lava Blaze 2 5G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.
- To clear the cache, select **Clear Cache**.

![clear cached data on xiaomi 5a](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/clear-cached-data-on-xiaomi5a.png)

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Lava Blaze 2 5G device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Lava Blaze 2 5G device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Lava Blaze 2 5G device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Lava Blaze 2 5G Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

- Open the **Settings**.
- Navigate to the A**dditional settings** section of the Lava Blaze 2 5G Redmi 5A settings.
- Please scroll down the screen until you reach the **Backup & reset** option, then click to access it.
- Click**Erase all data (factory reset)** to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Lava Blaze 2 5G Redmi 5A.
- Select **All files on the phone**to make a complete format of the Lava Blaze 2 5G Redmi 5A.
