**Adjust Brightness Mindfully**

Optimize brightness settings based on ambient lighting. Avoid excessively high brightness levels, which can strain your eyes and impact battery life.

- **Update Regularly**

Keep your phone's software up-to-date to benefit from performance enhancements, bug fixes, and display optimizations provided by system updates.

- **Be Mindful of Background Apps**

Close unused background apps to free up system resources and prevent unnecessary strain on your phone's display and overall performance.

- **Use Static Wallpapers**

Dynamic wallpapers and live backgrounds consume more power. Opt for static wallpapers to reduce battery drain and maintain consistent display performance.

- **Implement Screen Timeout**

Set a screen timeout to turn off the display when not in use automatically. This conserves battery life and prevents unnecessary wear on the screen.

- **Clean Your Screen Regularly**

Fingerprints, dust, and smudges can affect display clarity. Clean your screen regularly with a microfiber cloth to ensure a crisp and vibrant view.

- **Secure Your Phone**

Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access. This protects your data and ensures the display remains secure and untouched.

- **Enable Night Mode**

Many phones offer a night mode that reduces blue light emission. It promotes better sleep and reduces eye strain, especially during nighttime use.

Some apps have specific display settings. Explore and adjust these settings within individual apps to enhance your visual experience and reduce strain.
