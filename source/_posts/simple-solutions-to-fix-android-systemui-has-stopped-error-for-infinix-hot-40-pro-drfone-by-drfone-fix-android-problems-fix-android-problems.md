#### **3\. Shift the App from SD Card to device’s memory**

This method is strictly for certain Apps which cannot be updated because they are stored on an external memory card, i.e., SD Card.

Try updating the App now. If the Apps’s update does not download even now, DO NOT worry. There are three more ways to help you.

#### **4\. Unmount your external Memory Card**

Error Code963 may also occur due to an external memory chip used in your device to enhance its storage capacity. This is very common and can be dealt with by unmounting the SD Card temporarily.

To unmount your SD Card:
