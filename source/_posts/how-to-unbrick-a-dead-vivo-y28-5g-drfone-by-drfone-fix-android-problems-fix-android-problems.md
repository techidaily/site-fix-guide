## Part 1. Early Warning Signs of a Hard-bricked One Plus Device

When a phone "bricks," the Vivo Y28 5G device becomes completely unusable and non-functional. It essentially turns into a "brick." A bricked Vivo Y28 5G device can be preceded by certain warning signs that you should be attentive to. Here are some of them below.

- **Corrupted Device and Boot Failures.**If your Vivo Y28 5G freezes or fails to boot up properly, it can indicate underlying software issues that might lead to bricking.
- **Inability to Enter Fastboot Mode.**If you find it increasingly challenging to access the fastboot mode, it could signify impending trouble.
- **Consistent Black Screens.**Experiencing recurring black screens could indicate problems within the operating system. In the long run, this might escalate to bricking.
- **Unexpected Reboots and Crashes.**Frequent and unprovoked reboots, app crashes, and system instability might point toward software inconsistencies. Similar to consistent black screens, this could eventually lead to bricking.

### Common Reasons for Your Vivo Y28 5G Phone To Be Bricked

Understanding the factors that can trigger bricking in Vivo Y28 5G devices is essential for preventing such scenarios.

#### Failed Updates or Interrupted Installations

When a firmware update is interrupted due to power loss, sudden device shutdown, or other disruptions, it can result in incomplete software installation and potential bricking.

#### Unauthorized User Modifications

Engaging in root access, flashing custom ROMs, or applying unsupported system modifications can destabilize the Vivo Y28 5G device's software, paving the way for bricking.

#### Incorrect Bootloader Unlocking

Mishandling the process of unlocking the bootloader, a crucial step for customization can lead to system inconsistencies and eventual bricking.

#### Compatibility Issues With Custom Software

Installing unofficial custom software, such as custom recoveries or third-party kernels, might not be compatible with the Vivo Y28 5G device's hardware or official software. That can cause conflicts that can lead to bricking.

#### Malware or Virus Infiltration

The presence of malicious software can cause significant disruptions to the Vivo Y28 5G device's functioning. It can lead to bricking if left unchecked.

## Part 1: Understanding Stuck and Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs on Phone Screens

While dead and ****stuck pixels on the phone**** may seem similar, there are important distinctions between the two. Read on to discover the differences and what causes them.

### Stuck Vivo Y28 5Gs on Phone

A ****stuck pixel phone**** is always on, so it shows up on a touchscreen as a bright, persistent dot of red, green, blue, or white. Combinations are also possible, and although it is usually stationary, this dot occasionally flickers.

### Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs on Smartphones

In contrast to the stuck pixel, the dead pixel subpixels are all left unpowered, turning them off. A ****dead pixel on the phone**** is a tiny, persistent rectangle of black or white color on the part of the phone screen not working.

![stuck white pixel and dead pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-02.jpg)

### Some Differences Between Stuck and Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs on Phone

Stuck pixels may have less effect on the user experience than ****dead pixels on the phone**** **screen** since they still display color. But dead pixels may be more disturbing because they are either black or white.

It is easy to mistake stuck and ****dead pixels on the phone**** for one other, but they are unique issues with different causes and effects. Read on to understand the differences and how they affect your phone's display.

- ****Power****. The stuck pixel on your device always receives energy, causing it to display a specific color while the dead pixel is permanently off, resulting in a black spot on your phone screen.
- ****Possibility of repair****. You can quickly fix ****stuck pixels on the phone,****while some may even disappear on their own. However, dead pixels are more challenging to repair.
- ****Occurrence****. The stuck pixel is a common issue that often affects older or less-used displays, while dead pixels rarely appear on digital cameras and sensors.

### Factors That Contribute to Stuck and Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs on Mobile Devices

Stuck and ****dead pixels on phone screen****s can happen for various reasons, including manufacturing defects, physical damage, and age-related wear and tear. These ****broken pixels on the phone**** can hurt the user experience, and it is essential to know the root causes to prevent them from occurring in the first place.

- ****Manufacturing defects****. During manufacturing, some pixels may not work due to poor quality control, resulting in stuck or ****dead pixels on the phone**** In other words, if the power transfer issue isn't completely fixed, you might see more dead pixels.
- ****Physical damage****. Accidents such as dropping the phone or exposure to extreme heat or cold can damage the screen and cause stuck or dead pixels. For instance, the ****upper part of the touch screen not working****may also occur due to pressure on the display when the phone is placed in a pocket with other sharp objects.

![person holding a gadget with pen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-03.jpg)

- ****Age-related wear and tear****. Over time, the display on your phone may start to wear out, resulting in the appearance of dead or stuck pixels on the phone. It is more common in older devices and those with high usage rates. Factors such as exposure to sunlight or excessive phone use can also contribute to the issue.

## Part 2: How To Fix Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs on Phone Screens on Android Devices

It is essential to have the right tools and knowledge to ****fix dead pixels on your phone**** screen. Fortunately, you can use several effective techniques to address the issue. In this section, you will discover step-by-step instructions on how to ****fix dead pixels on phone**** screens on Android devices.

### Option 1: Check Phone Screen Appearance

****Step 1:**** Check for chips, cracks, or any other signs of damage on the screen if your ****phone touch screen is not working in some areas****. If you find any damage, you may need to take your phone to a professional repair shop or consider getting a replacement.

![phone with damaged screen from dropping](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-04.jpg)

****Step 2:**** If you have a screen protector or case, remove them because they can interfere with the process. This step will allow you to get a clear view of the screen and accurately assess the ****dead pixel on the phone****.

****Step 3:**** Remove any gloves you may be wearing and any stickers placed over the screen or sensors. Gloves and stickers can interfere with the touchscreen and affect the accuracy of fixing the ****broken pixels on the phone****.

****Step 4:**** Finally, ensure that your screen is clean and free from any smudges or dirt that could affect the accuracy of fixing ****dead pixels on the phone****. You can use a microfiber cloth to clean your screen gently, making sure not to apply too much pressure or use any harsh chemicals that could damage the screen.

****Step 1:**** Press and hold down the ****power key**** on your Vivo Y28 5G until the ****power menu**** appears.

****Step 2:**** Select ****Restart**** on your phone's screen. It will initiate a reboot of your device.

**Tip:**

If your Vivo Y28 5G is unresponsive to the usual restart method because a ****part of the phone screen is not working****, try a forced restart by holding the ****power button**** for at least 10 seconds.

### Option 3: Check If Stuck Vivo Y28 5G Phone Only Appears in Specific Mobile Apps

If the previous method did not work, check if the ****stuck pixels on the phone**** only appear in specific mobile apps. Sometimes, stuck pixels may only show up when using particular apps, so identifying which app is causing the issue can help pinpoint the problem.

****Step 1:**** Put your smartphone in ****Safe Mode****.

**Note:**

****Step 2:**** Try touching the screen while your phone is in safe mode. If the display functions as intended, a specific app is likely causing the issue with the ****stuck pixel phone**** display. Next, turn off ****Safe Mode****.

****Step 3:**** To resolve issues related to a problematic app on your phone, remove the most recent downloads one at a time, and restart your phone after each uninstallation. Check if uninstalling the app resolves the issue. Once you know the problematic app, you may install the other applications you deleted again.

### Option 4: Perform Factory Data Reset

Consider a factory data reset if the previous options did not resolve your issue with stuck or dead pixels on the phone screen. This process will erase all data from your device, so remember to back up any important information before proceeding.

****Step 1:**** Open the ****Settings**** application.

**Step 2:** Choose ****System > Reset > Erase all data (factory reset) > Erase all data****.

![smartphone reset settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/04/android-screen-stuck-general-phone-partly-screen-unresponsive-09.jpg)

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

Aside from the methods and tools discussed for fixing ****dead pixels on phone screen****s and ****stuck pixels on the phone****, you may still have some questions regarding the issues. Whether you are dealing with a single stuck pixel or a cluster of dead pixels, this section aims to provide you with helpful insights.

### 1\. Can Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs Fix Themselves?

No, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** is permanent. There is a much lower chance that dead pixels will self-correct over time. They are often impossible to fix using any of the widely used techniques. Unlike stuck pixels, they rarely have a chance of recovery. Before giving up, verify if the pixel is dead, as stuck pixels may be fixable.

### 2\. Can Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs Worsen?

Dead pixels cannot spread because each pixel functions independently of the others. Thus, a ****dead pixel on the phone**** does not affect surrounding pixels. However, it can be a nuisance for users, especially if it appears in prominent parts of the screen. Call an expert if you see that it is spreading so they can diagnose the issue and assess whether a repair is possible.

### 3\. Why Are Dead Vivo Y28 5Gs Spreading on My Vivo Y28 5G?

It simply signifies that this specific area of your screen had poor manufacturing quality or is physically damaged if you have a patch of closely spaced ****dead pixels on your phone****. When a group of dead pixels is close together, it indicates localized damage or defect to that specific area. So, the pixels in that region no longer produce light or color.

### 4\. How Many Stuck Vivo Y28 5Gs Are Acceptable?

It frequently happens throughout the LCD manufacturing process when one or more subpixels enter an unchanging state, leading to a bright or lifeless pixel. Generally speaking, an acceptable display has 1 to 5 fixed subpixels.

In addition, the essential factor in comparing dead pixel policies is whether or not the policy permits the Vivo Y28 5G devices to be returned, swapped, or repaired when this frequent issue arises.

## Conclusion

With this knowledge, you can apply the different tools and techniques for removing ****stuck pixels on phone**** screens and how to work around dead pixels on the phone screen. Whether using software like Dr.Fone or employing manual methods such as rebooting or cleaning your device, there are various options you can try.

Remember to back up your data before attempting any fixes and to seek professional help if necessary. If you are still experiencing issues with dead pixels on your phone screen, don't hesitate to contact your device manufacturer for further assistance.

Once Chrome has relaunched, you should be able to take screenshots in incognito mode by pressing the power and volume-down buttons at the same time.

Use Google Assistant

With Google Assistant, taking screenshots on your Vivo Y28 5G is now easier than ever. Just say, “Hey, Google, take a screenshot,” Google Assistant will capture the screen and save it to your gallery.

![google assistant command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/cant-take-screenshot-for-security-policy-09.jpg)

Use a Third-Party App To Take Screenshots

You can download several applications on Google Play Store if you still can’t take a screenshot due to security policy. Some popular third-party screenshot apps include:

- Screenshot Easy
- Screenshot Tile
- Screen Master: Screenshot Markup

Third-party screenshot apps often use different methods to capture the screen. These might bypass the security measures that prevent you from taking screenshots with the built-in screenshot function.

Capture Your Phone Display With Another Device

If you own another smartphone, you can use it to take a photo of the screen of the Vivo Y28 5G device you’re trying to take a screenshot of. This is a simple workaround for any security policies that may be in place. To do this, open the camera app on your other smartphone and point it at the screen of the first device.

Check the Banking App Settings for Screenshot Permissions

Some banking apps may turn off screenshots by default, but some may allow them in the settings. To check this, open the banking app and select the settings menu. Look for a setting that allows taking in-app photos. If you find it, enable it to allow screenshots to be taken in the app.

Screen Mirroring

Smart View allows you to display your Vivo Y28 5G device’s screen on your smart TV, where you can then take a screenshot of the TV to capture the app or website you need.

- **Step 1:** Swipe down the top of the screen to access the **Quick Settings** panel.
- **Step 2:** Tap the **Smart View** icon.
- **Step 3:** Select your TV from the list of available devices and tap **Start Now**.

Alternatively, if you don’t have a smart TV, you can still mirror your phone screen display to your desktop or tablet using the Vivo Y28 5G Flow app and take a screenshot of your phone’s screen instead.

Use Disable Flag Secure Magisk Module

Still experiencing the error message, “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy?” Bypass Android** phone error like this using a module.

The module patches the Android framework to remove the FLAG\_SECURE flag from apps. It is a relatively simple process but requires root access and Magisk. This module will turn off the security flag to take screenshots in Incognito mode and other apps.

Authors Verdict

There are a few ways to bypass screenshot restrictions on Android apps and websites, but some methods are more complicated than others. All methods should work, but if you think your device has been compromised, it is important to check if it is a system issue.

You can use a third-party tool like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) without rooting your device. It is easy to use and supports many Android smartphones. You can try Dr.Fone for free to test if it supports your device and can fix the underlying system issues.

## Conclusion

You can fix the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error on Android in different ways. But it depends on the cause of the error. If an app is causing the error, you can try two things. First, remove the app’s screenshot restriction. Second, download a different screenshot app or a different device to take screenshots.

Although there are ways to bypass the “**Can’t take screenshot due to security policy**” error message, it’s crucial to know why screenshots are not allowed. Many apps and websites do not permit it to protect sensitive information, prevent piracy, and follow regulations. They also do it to prevent fraud, protect user privacy, and safeguard intellectual property.

If you think the issue is with your Android system, or your device becomes bricked after trying other methods, experiencing app crashes, or otherwise malfunctioning, try using the Dr.Fone System Repair tool. It is worth trying and can fix most Android system issues in a few minutes.
