### Fix 8: Factory reset Android

It is always considered the most used way to factory reset your phone in order to resolve the process system not responding error. Though, this should be your last resort, as it will wipe off your device’s data entirely. Even if you are performing a factory reset, make sure that you back up your data by using a reliable tool like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).



### [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/)

Flexibly Back up and Restore Android Data

- Back up Android data to the computer with one click.
- Preview and restore selectively the backup to any Android device.
- Supports 8000+ Android devices.
- There is no data lost during backup, export, or restoration.

**3,981,454** people have downloaded it

If your phone is functioning, then you can easily factory reset it by visiting Settings > General > Backup & Restore and selecting the option of “Factory Data Reset”. Your device will display a warning regarding all the data files that would be lost or un-synced. Just tap on the “Reset” button to factory reset your device.

![reset phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980670512565.jpg)

If your device is not functioning or locked, then you can perform the factory reset operation by putting your phone into Recovery mode. Most of the time, it can be done by pressing the Power and Volume up button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. Though, the key combinations might change from one device to another.

![factory reset phone in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980670718056.jpg)

After entering the Recovery mode, go to the “wipe data/factory reset” option using the Volume up and down button. Use the Power button to make a selection. If you get an additional message, then select the “yes – delete all data” option. When it is done, you can simply reboot your device.

### Fix 9: Unroot the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device

It has been further discovered that the process system isn’t responding error is more common in rooted devices. Therefore, if you also have a rooted Android device, then you can choose to unroot it in order to fix this issue. There are different ways to unroot an Android device. One of the easiest ways to do it is by using the SuperSU app.

You can always download either SuperSU or SuperSU Pro app from its website [here](https://supersuroot.org/). Simply install it on our device and launch it whenever you wish to unroot it. Visit its “Settings” tab and select the option of “Full unroot”.

![full unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671048148.jpg)

This will generate a warning message regarding all the repercussions of the unrooting process. Just tap on “Continue” to initiate the process.

![continue unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671247132.jpg)

If you are using an older version of Android, then you might get another pop-up to restore boot images. Simply make the desired selection and start the process. After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.

![restore stock boot image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671431228.jpg)

Now that you know different ways to fix the **process system not responding** error, you can easily overcome this issue and make the most out of your device. Simply start with the easy fixes, and if they don’t work, then take extreme measures like unrooting your device or restoring it to factory setting. Also, make sure to back up your data before taking any extreme measures.
