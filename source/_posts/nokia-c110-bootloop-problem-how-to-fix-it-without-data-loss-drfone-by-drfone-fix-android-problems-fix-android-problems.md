## Part 3: 3 Common fixes if a particular App won’t open

In this segment, we will discuss the three best ways to help you fix the problem if only a particular App won't open/launch/ run and takes an indefinite time to load.

1\. Update the App

It is always advisable to keep your Android software as well as your Apps up-to-date and you must constantly check for any updates which may be available in the Google Play Store.

Follow the steps given below to update the app which won't open on your phone:

• Visit Google Play Store on your Nokia C110.

![Visit Google Play Store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984583996008.jpg)

• Now select “My Apps & Games” from the main menu.

![select “My Apps & Games](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183627979.jpg)

• In this step, you may click on “Update All” to update all Apps for which an update is available or manually select the Apps which you wish to Update.

![Update All](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984183782889.jpg)

Once the App is updated, close all Apps and tabs running in the background. Now try to launch the app once again. If it opens, your problem is solved. If not, DO NOT worry as there are more ways to help you.

2\. Force Stop the App

Closing the App completely which won't open on your phone is a good idea. To make sure that no operations are running in the background related to the App, you must “Force Stop” it. Doing this is extremely simple and all you need to do is follow the steps given herein under:

• Visit “Settings” on your phone.

• Click on “Apps” to see a list of all the Apps on your Nokia C110.

![Click on “Apps”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184003158.jpg)

• Select the App which won't open.

• Now click on “Force Stop” as shown below.

![click on “Force Stop”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184186018.jpg)

3\. Clear App Cache and Data

This method resolves the issue to a great extent by wiping off unnecessary App content from your device.

Carefully follow the step-by-step instructions given below to clear all App cache and data:

• Visit “Settings” and select “Apps”.

• From the list of Apps that appears, select the App that won't open.

• Now tap on “Clear Cache” and “Clear data” directly or under “Storage”.

![Clear data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984585184488.jpg)

## Part 4: 3 Common fix if all Apps won’t open on Android

In this segment, we will discuss solutions to the problem if all your Apps won't open. They are simple and easy to follow and solve the error in no time.

1\. Android updates

Firstly, it is very important to keep your Android software updated at all times as an old Android version might not support new Apps or updated Apps.

To update your software:

• Visit “Settings” and keep going downwards.

• Now select “About Phone”.

• From the options available on the screen, tap on “System Updates"

![tap on “System Updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184697337.jpg)

• In this step, if you are prompted for an update, follow the instruction given and do so.

Updating your Android software solves most of your problems. This method might sound weird but works wonders when it comes to App related issues.

2\. Restart the phone

Restarting your Nokia C110 to fix an error might sound old school but it gives good results when your Apps won't open. Restarting your phone is fairly simple. All you need to do is:

• Long press the power button.

• Now click on “Restart”.

![click on “Restart”](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984184913200.jpg)

Your phone will automatically restart and once it does, you can try to launch the App. You may also restart your Nokia C110 by pressing the power button for about 15-20 seconds.

3\. Reset Factory Settings

This method is a little tedious and must be last on your list. Also, make sure you take a backup of all your data and contents stored on your Nokia C110 and this solution will completely wipe off your phone making as good as a new smartphone.

To Factory Reset your Nokia C110, carefully follow the guidelines given below:

• Visit “Settings” to find the “Backup and reset” option as shown in the screenshot below.

![Backup and reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984185141857.jpg)

• Now click on “Factory Data Reset”>“Reset Device”>“Erase Everything”

![Erase Everything](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14984185334400.jpg)

Your phone will now reboot and will be required to set up from scratch.

“Why Won’t my App open” is a question asked by many Android phone users who fear that the problem occurs due to a virus attack or a system failure. However, this is not the case. The reason for the error to the surface is quite minor and can be fixed by you, sitting at home, without resorting to any kind of technical or external assistance. The solutions listed above are easy to understand and not very time-consuming.

So go ahead and try them out now!
