![camera not working error in android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-1.jpg)

## Part I: Why Is Android Camera Not Working?

There are a few reasons why the camera app is not working on your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G.

**Low Memory**

Camera app does rely heavily on system resources, so in case you have too many apps open and for some reason the OS is not able to manage the resources appropriately for the camera app to function as it should, you will get a camera error.

**Low Storage**

The camera app needs storage space to save the photos it takes. So, in case your phone is running low on storage space, the camera app would likely malfunction as it would have no way to store the photos it would be taking.

**General Bugs And Glitches**

OS bugs and general glitches within the OS and the camera app can cause camera not working issue anytime during everyday operation. This is part and parcel of any technology.

**Hardware Issues**

In the rarest cases, there might have developed an actual hardware issue with the camera system on your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G. The likely culprit is misuse and abuse, such as a dropped phone or maybe the phone was too hot for extended periods of time, causing hardware issues.

## Part II: How To Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue?

So, how to get the Android camera not working problem solved? There are a few ways you can try fixing the camera not working issue on your Samsung Galaxy F14 5G right where you are, without needing to take the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device to the manufacturer’s service center.

### II.I: Restart The Handset

One of the first things to do any time an app or your phone or tablet does not work like it should, restarting the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device refreshes everything just enough to resolve most commonly occurring issues.

![restarting android handset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-2.jpg)

Use the power button on your smartphone to restart your Android handset and see if this resolves the issue.

### II.II: Close And Relaunch The Camera App

If the camera app (or any app for that matter) has been in the background for a while and then it is brought to the foreground, there are always chances of it crashing for any reason, or not working as expected. So, closing the app completely and relaunching it is recommended.

Step 1: Launch the app switcher on your specific Android device the way your device manufacturer suggests you to. Usually, it is a swipe up and hold gesture to get into the app switcher.

![closing apps in app switcher](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-3.jpg)

Step 2: Next, you can choose to close just the camera app or, better yet, close all apps by tapping the Close All button. Flicking any app upwards (quick upward swipe) is how you close an app. If there is no Close All button anywhere, repeat the gesture for all open apps.

### II.III: Check App Permissions

These days, thanks to strides in the privacy initiatives, apps need permissions before they can function the way they do. Most of the times, apps such as camera do have the necessary permissions, but sometimes it is possible that the permissions are set incorrectly. To check if the camera app has the requisite permissions, do the following:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Permissions.

![camera permissions check android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-4.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Camera.

![set camera permissions android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-5.jpg)

Step 3: See if the selected option is Allow Only While Using This App. If not, select it.

### II.IV: Clear The Camera App Cache

Clearing the camera app cache is sometimes helpful. To do that:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera and tap Storage Usage.

![clear camera app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-6.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

![clear camera app cache android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-7.jpg)

### II.V: Clear The Photo Gallery App Cache

The camera app is closely tied to the photo gallery app that comes baked in into Android OS. That is because photos that the camera app takes are stored in the photo gallery app. Consequently, if there were any issues in the photo gallery app, that could lead to the camera app not working on Android problem. Here’s how to clear the photo gallery app cache:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Apps > Photos > Storage Usage.

![clear photo gallery app cache](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-8.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Clear Cache.

### II.VI: Check For App Updates

This does not happen always, but sometimes, with known bugs and issues, there may be an update released that fixes those bugs and issues that prevent some users from using a given app reliably. Checking for updates is a good step to make sure that your camera app is updated to the latest version possible.

Step 1: Go to Play Store and tap your profile picture on the right.

![google play store app updates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-9.jpg)

Step 2: Tap Manage Apps and Device.

![check for app updates play store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/android-camera-not-working-10.jpg)

Step 3: If there are updates available, Tap Update All to update all apps.

### II.VII: Cool The Phone Down

We do not realize the immense power that is packed into the thin smartphone form factor these days. If you have been using the phone to video chat for a while now, you might not realize that the phone has become hot, especially if you are using a desk stand. Same for shooting high-resolution videos; the phone does get quite hot shooting high-resolution videos.

If this is the case, close all apps and let the phone cool down. You might even want to shut the phone off to help cool it faster.

### II.VIII: Nudge The Camera System

You may want to tap your camera system (the lenses and surrounding area) gently to see if that gets the camera working. In case it did, this is indicative of a hardware issue, and you should get it checked at the service center at your earliest convenience.

### II.IX: Fix Android Camera Not Working Issue In One Click (With Dr.Fone)

### Fix 8: Factory reset Android

It is always considered the most used way to factory reset your phone in order to resolve the process system not responding error. Though, this should be your last resort, as it will wipe off your device’s data entirely. Even if you are performing a factory reset, make sure that you back up your data by using a reliable tool like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/).



### [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/)

Flexibly Back up and Restore Android Data

- Preview and restore selectively the backup to any Android device.

If your phone is functioning, then you can easily factory reset it by visiting Settings > General > Backup & Restore and selecting the option of “Factory Data Reset”. Your device will display a warning regarding all the data files that would be lost or un-synced. Just tap on the “Reset” button to factory reset your device.

![reset phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980670512565.jpg)

If your device is not functioning or locked, then you can perform the factory reset operation by putting your phone into Recovery mode. Most of the time, it can be done by pressing the Power and Volume up button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds. Though, the key combinations might change from one device to another.

![factory reset phone in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980670718056.jpg)

After entering the Recovery mode, go to the “wipe data/factory reset” option using the Volume up and down button. Use the Power button to make a selection. If you get an additional message, then select the “yes – delete all data” option. When it is done, you can simply reboot your device.

### Fix 9: Unroot the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device

It has been further discovered that the process system isn’t responding error is more common in rooted devices. Therefore, if you also have a rooted Android device, then you can choose to unroot it in order to fix this issue. There are different ways to unroot an Android device. One of the easiest ways to do it is by using the SuperSU app.

You can always download either SuperSU or SuperSU Pro app from its website [here](https://supersuroot.org/). Simply install it on our device and launch it whenever you wish to unroot it. Visit its “Settings” tab and select the option of “Full unroot”.

![full unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671048148.jpg)

This will generate a warning message regarding all the repercussions of the unrooting process. Just tap on “Continue” to initiate the process.

![continue unroot](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/06/14980671247132.jpg)

If you are using an older version of Android, then you might get another pop-up to restore boot images. Simply make the desired selection and start the process. After a while, your device would be restarted the usual way, and it would be unrooted. Most probably, this will resolve the process system isn’t responding error as well.

Now that you know different ways to fix the **process system not responding** error, you can easily overcome this issue and make the most out of your device. Simply start with the easy fixes, and if they don’t work, then take extreme measures like unrooting your device or restoring it to factory setting. Also, make sure to back up your data before taking any extreme measures.
