### 3. Contact Custom Service

![xiaomi contact customer service](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/xiaomi-customer-service-1.jpg)

If restarting the Oppo F23 5G device or allowing the battery to drain doesn't resolve the issue, seeking professional assistance is recommended. The manufacturer may provide additional troubleshooting steps or recommend sending the Oppo F23 5G device in for repair or replacement. It's important to check the warranty before contacting customer service, which may affect repair or replacement options.

In addition to the common solutions we discussed earlier, some model-specific solutions can help resolve the screen unresponsiveness issue on Oppo F23 5G Y2 and Oppo F23 5G 5A.

### 4. Optimize Device Performance

One solution is to optimize the Oppo F23 5G device performance by clearing the cache, removing unwanted apps, and disabling unnecessary features. This method can help free up memory and resolve the issue.

You can clear your cached data using the default settings.

- Select **Settings**\> **Storage** > **Cached Data**.
- To clear the cache, select **Clear Cache**.

### 5. Back Up And Factory Reset

Another solution is to back up the Oppo F23 5G device and perform a factory reset, which can help reset the Oppo F23 5G device to its original state and remove any software glitches that may be causing the screen unresponsiveness. The factory settings on your phone will restore any data saved by third-party applications and some of the phone's settings when it was first built. Note that this method erases all data from the Oppo F23 5G device, so it should only be considered a last resort.

In the following steps, we will show you how to format the Oppo F23 5G Redmi 5A to erase all your data and restore it to its factory state.

- Open the **Settings**.
- Navigate to the A**dditional settings** section of the Oppo F23 5G Redmi 5A settings.
- Please scroll down the screen until you reach the **Backup & reset** option, then click to access it.
- Click**Erase all data (factory reset)** to restore the network settings and applications, or completely reset the Oppo F23 5G Redmi 5A.
- Select **All files on the phone**to make a complete format of the Oppo F23 5G Redmi 5A.
