## Part 4. Android Stuck at System Recovery? How to fix in a common way?

If, however, your device is stuck on system recovery mode, here's how you can easily get it out of system recovery. The process is slightly different for different Android devices, so you should check your device's manual before attempting this process.

Step 1: Power off the Realme V30 device, and just to be sure, take out the battery to ensure that the Realme V30 device is fully turned off. Then reinsert the battery.

Step 2: Press and hold down the Home button, Power Button, and the Volume up Key simultaneously until the Realme V30 device vibrates.

Step 3: Once you feel the vibration, release the power button but continue to hold down the Home and Volume up Key. The Android recovery screen will display. Release the Volume up and Home buttons.

Step 4: Press the Volume down key to select the "Wipe Data/ Factory Reset option and then press the Power button to select it.

Step 5: Next, you need to press the Volume down button to highlight "Delete All User Data" and then press the Power button to select it. The device will reset and present the "Reboot System Now" option.

Step 6: Finally, press the Power button to [reboot the phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/reboot-android.html) in normal mode.

## Part 5. Backup and Restore Android System

Losing data on your Realme V30 is a common occurrence, and since Android devices don't really have an automatic full backup solution, it is important to know how to backup and restore your device system. Here's how to easily do that.

Step 1: Enter the recovery mode on your Realme V30, as described in Part 2 above. Use the Volume and Power keys to select the "Backup & Restore" option on the screen.

Step 2: Tap on the backup option or use the Volume and Power keys if your screen is unresponsive. This will begin backing up your system to the SD card.

Step 3: After the process is complete, choose "Reboot" to restart the Realme V30 device.

Step 4: You can then simply check Recovery > backup directory on your SD card. You can rename it to easily find it later during the restore process.

To restore the system from the backup created, follow these simple steps.

Step 1: Once again, enter recovery mode as described in part 2 above and then choose Backup & Restore from the menu list.

Step 2: Press "Restore" to begin the recovery process from the Backup file we created

Step 3: You will be notified when the system restore is complete.

Android system recovery mode can be quite useful, especially when your system is unresponsive. As we have also seen, it is important to know how to get into and out of System Recovery mode if you are going to backup and restore your Android system. It is also quite easy to do both of these things.
