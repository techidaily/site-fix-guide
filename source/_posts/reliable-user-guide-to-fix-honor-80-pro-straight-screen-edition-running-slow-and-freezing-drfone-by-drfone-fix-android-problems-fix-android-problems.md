There can be many potential reasons why **Android phone runs slow** suddenly. But it doesn’t mean it cannot be restored at all to its original state and function.

In this article, we will review the details of this Android phone issue. We’ll provide solutions you can try if you ever get caught in the same problem. Continue reading to learn more.

## Understanding the Specs That Make Android Phones Run Fast

The issue of Android phone running slow and freezing is not limited to old devices only. The same problem has also been observed in newly purchased units. The roots of this unfortunate occurrence vary from one user to another. It depends on different elements, from external factors like users’ handling of the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device to internal factors such as its capabilities. To understand it more, below are some Android phone specifications related to the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device's overall performance and speed.

### The CPU Core Count

Unlike before, Android phones today are equipped with several cores. Each of them has the ability to execute a process alone. Therefore, the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device can handle two or more tasks at once without compromising the quality of its performance. If your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition contains more CPU core, its performance surely be more powerful and speedy.

### The CPU Clock Speed

Simply put, clock speed is basically the speed at which the CPU cores can carry out a cycle in a second. A faster clock speed definitely translates into the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device’s higher performance. For instance, an octa-core Android phone with a one GHz per second clock speed is a decent device. But it’s less powerful than a device with the same number of cores but runs at two GHz per second.

### Random Access Memory

In a simple language, Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores the data from apps that are currently running. Smartphones can be more flexible with multi-tasking if their RAM has enough space. So if you’re among these users who perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you better choose a device with more RAM.

### Internal Storage

The mobile applications installed on your smartphones are directly related to internal storage. The apps save their data every time, so they behave strangely when the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device runs out of storage. If you’re using heavy mobile applications, it’s best to opt for smartphones with huge internal storage.

## Reasons Why My Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition is Running Slow

It’s not really hard to tell why your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition is slow because it’s apparently a common issue among users. But don’t worry. Most of the time, the problem is not a major concern. Here are some scenarios that may slow down your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Editions.

### Overloading Background Processes

It’s great to have an Android phone that can flawlessly multi-task. However, not all units can handle that well. As mentioned earlier, it depends on the CPU core count and the core’s clock speed. If your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition is running slow and freezing, many processes may be happening at the same time. Your device’s cores and clock speed are potentially incapable of executing such demands.

### Your Phone is Running Out of Storage

Mobile apps need to save data on your phone. They perform the tasks based on the data stored on the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device. So if your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition is slow, it’s possible that your device is already running out of storage. Each app has its own storage requirement. If your phone goes below that, the app will surely crash and not work.

## Common Causes of Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Screen Unresponsiveness

While Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition devices offer reliable performance, users may encounter situations where the screen becomes unresponsive or stuck on boot. Soft-bricked software or corrupted firmware can cause an Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device to become unresponsive, including the screen stuck on the boot. This can happen to various models, such as the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition, A37, A5, and A5s. Software updates and resets can help fix these issues.

Over time, the touch screen of an Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device may become unresponsive due to wear and tear. This can happen to models like the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition F1s and F3. In this case, replacing the touch screen or seeking professional assistance may be necessary.

Dropping or impacting an Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device can cause physical damage to the touch screen, resulting in unresponsiveness. This can happen to various models like the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Reno and Find X. In some cases, the damage may be repairable, but the screen replacement or the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device itself may be necessary in severe cases. Protecting the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device with a case and handling it carefully to prevent physical damage is important.

While Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition devices are generally reliable, various factors can contribute to screen unresponsiveness. Users can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues by identifying these potential causes and seeking appropriate solutions.

Installing apps from unknown sources or suspicious websites can expose the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device to malware and viruses, which can cause unresponsiveness and other issues. To avoid this, it's recommended to only install apps from trusted sources such as the Google Play Store or the Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition App Store.

Using a reliable tool like Dr. Fone can help prevent Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Screen unresponsiveness by allowing you to manage and repair your device's software and data.
