It has been possible due to the extensive availability of mobile applications. However, it can be incredibly frustrating when your favorite apps keep crashing repeatedly.

You're not alone if you're an Android user who encounters app crashes. This article will explore ten practical ways to fix apps that keep crashing on Android devices. We will also discuss the causes behind app crashes and how to prevent them.

## Part 1: What Are the Causes Behind Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

There are many reasons for ****the app crashing**** on Android devices. These reasons range from insufficient storage space to bugs and glitches in the apps. Finding out the root cause of an app crashing is important so that you can find the appropriate solution. Discussed below are some of the reasons why your Android apps keep crashing:

### Insufficient Memory

When a device is low on memory, it may struggle to run multiple apps simultaneously. Each app requires memory to store its data and execute its processes. If the available memory is limited, it can cause apps to crash. That happens because they don't have enough resources to operate properly.

### Software Compatibility

Android devices come in various models and run different operating system versions. That's why it is essential to use apps compatible with your device. Since there are a lot of Android variants, it is hard to optimize apps for all devices. An app not optimized for an Android version or device leads to crashes or malfunctions.

### Outdated Apps

Apps are regularly updated to introduce new features, fix bugs, and enhance performance. Using an outdated version of an app may cause instability or compatibility problems. Since the app is not optimized for the current version of Android, it can keep crashing.

### Network Problems

Some apps rely heavily on network connectivity to function properly. They need a stable and strong internet connection to perform all the functions. These apps can crash if there are network connectivity issues, such as a weak Wi-Fi or network outage. Unstable connections can disrupt data transmission, making the app's function challenging.

### App Bugs

Despite rigorous testing, apps can still have bugs or coding errors that lead to crashes. Bugs in apps can occur due to various reasons. It mostly relates to incorrect implementation of features or unexpected user interactions. App developers work to identify and fix these bugs, often releasing updates.

## Part 2: How to Fix the Apps Keep Crashing on Android?

If the Realme GT Neo 5 device can boot to the recovery screen, you can find an alternative ROM to install and copy it your device. Installation can then be done in the recovery menu. If the Realme GT Neo 5 device is booting to recovery mode there is a chance that it can be fixed.

Step 1: Load up Clockworkmod or any other recovery tool that you have been using.

Step 2: Once you are in, navigate to the “Reboot system now.” If you are using Clockworkmod, this should be your first option. Hopefully everything will work just right if you do this, If it doesn’t you may need to download and re-flash the ROM again.

Step 6: Finally reboot the Realme GT Neo 5 device by selecting “Reboot system now.” This should fix the problem. You may also want to flash the same ROM or try a new one.

You can return to resource where you found the flash tools and search or ask for advice

Sometimes these errors can be caused if the ROM installation was performed via SD card. In this case reformatting the SD card might help.

If all else fails, it is time to returning the Realme GT Neo 5 device to the vendor if your warranty is still applicable.

## Part 3: Useful Tips to avoid Bricking your Android Phone

If you are planning on installing custom ROM you need to install Custom Recovery. This will enable you restore the Realme GT Neo 5 device to its original settings should anything go wrong and hopefully help you avoid bricking your device.

1. Ensure that you are familiar with the Fastboot or ADB commands before doing anything. You should know how to recover your device by flashing a command line and also manually transfer important files to your device.
2. Make a backup of your device. This is obvious but most people fail to adhere to it. At the very least you can get back all your files and settings to transfer to a new phone.
3. Keep a full Nandroid backup on your phone
4. Keep another backup on your PC which you can access should anything go wrong with the Custom ROM installation
5. Know how to hard reset your device. It may come in handy when your device freezes on you.
6. You should also consider enabling USB debugging. This is because many solutions for a Bricked device rely on USB debugging.
7. Ensure the Custom ROM you choose can actually be used on your device model.

While installing Custom ROM can actually be a great way to customize your device, it is also the leading reason for bricked devices. Therefore ensure that you understand what you are doing when you decide to customize your device. Learn as much as you can about the process before attempting everything.
